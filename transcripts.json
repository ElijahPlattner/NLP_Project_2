        "transcript": "we are going to Rome with you, Xavier, with a revolution in the Vatican. it is not every day. the blessing of homosexual couples is now authorized by the Church. yes, a very, very big step forward, wanted by Francis himself. but we are going to listen to \u00c9isabeth. everything, immediately, the words of Francis. he spoke on the subject last February already, on board his plane: people with homosexual tendencies, children of God. God loves them, God is with them, God accompanies them. Pope Francis confided his deep conviction there: God makes no difference between his children. so as early as July 2013,, 10 years ago already, he uttered a sentence which bristles, which still bristles today. the most conservative in the Catholic Church, remember he said, about a homosexual priest who am I to judge. yesterday, the dicaster for the Doctrine of the Faith, the ministry which deals with this doctrine, published a text Cign\u00e9 by Fran\u00e7ois and which affirms: it is possible to bless couples in an irregular situation- unmarried couples, divorced couples and same-sex couples- in a form which must not be ritually fixed by the ecclesial authorities. so we will decipher the blessing a little. the homosexual couple is therefore clearly authorized in a doctrinal declaration of the Vatican, that is to say that this is is engraved in the marble of the Vatican, and this will remain. in Germany, in Belgium already, certain priests blessed homosexual unions, but in all discretion and without the approval of Rome. we see this photo taken in Germany, in Berlin, in March 2021, dicaster for the Doctrine of the Faith, the same, therefore, had declared that this practice was illicit. it is therefore indeed, Elizabeth, a revolution that Francis has just accomplished towards homosexuals, the divorced and remarried, unmarried people who will be able to receive from a priest, therefore, really in a religious framework, a blessing, the benevolence of God, a strong but precise priestly act. the Vatican, which must not be ritual, no confusion with the blessing specific to the sacrament of marriage. it has absolutely nothing, nothing to do. the blessing will never be accomplished, for example, at the same time that the law of civil union. we will not be able to go and get married at the town hall and then go to a church as we do for a wedding. couples will not have to, for example, wear clothes specific to the wedding. no, wedding dress, no of ceremonial. in a way, Fran\u00e7ois, we don't have the right to dress as we want. of course, we start as we want, but we will have to avoid having clothes that recall the wedding ceremony to distinguish between the sacrament of marriage and blessing. Francis knows that he is on a crest, that the most conservative within his church are increasing their criticism of his governance and castigating what they call a loss of direction, and for them that's one. so the Pope celebrated days ago. look at these images, which I found, frankly, magnificent. he celebrated his 87th birthday surrounded by children. he knows that he has little time left to accomplish his mission. for Francis, homosexuality is always a sin, but it is not a crime. the blessing of homosexual couples by the Catholic Church sounds like a call to order for countries which still today criminalize homosexuality and, in some, homosexuals risk the death penalty before giving you the right word. it is a sin that we bless. it is compatible that sin, it has a sin, but we bless a union. we bless two people. we give them the good we bless, not sin. eh, we bless people, yes, yes, but we consider that it is always in the list of sins that we cathechize. there is always hexuality. it is not a crime, yeah, and and above all, he wants to avoid the death penalty, above all for homosexuals. there are still 11 countries in Africa which still penalize homosexuality, including Sudan and Mauritania, where it is considered a death sentence, and often with the support of local churches and in particular bishops, who go in the direction of the power in place and tr, ENIT, auom. in Europe homosexuals are preserved, but in certain countries this is not at all the case. in Africa, in Asia also. it is important not to pronounce the word marriage, but it is something apart from the beginning of the marriage. you're right, it's an open door. we're not going to be an open door, but we'll see if the next PAP closes the door a little. Fran\u00e7ois knows that it will end one day and that things will evolve all the time, way they are obliged to evolve with their times. eh, since homosexual marriages today are 7000 per year, uh, for 21000, eh, yeah, that's it: 22, 21000, so one on TR. so here the Church must move forward because that it is in Perre of speed, in particular marrage of the priests. there is still very, very strong resistance of women priests. we see the reactions they are, they are very, very lively and in both camps there is, there is a real, a real happiness in the progressive homosexual camp to see himself recognized in some way by the Catholic lise, by his church, and on the other side, among the more traditional conservative people, the thing goes much less well. some people elsewhere say: in fact, Francis is not my pope will be interested. this is the statement that we can find would be interesting to hear the organizers of the demonstration for all on this subject, who claim a lot of Catholicism, yes, and and besides, there are certain Catholics who also say that it It is by opening his voice to more progressivism that he will scare away certain Catholics and scare away the faithful.",

        "transcript": "the Vatican, which publishes a document which authorizes the blessing of homosexual couples. what should we think of it? was there a better way to prepare for the Christmas holidays other than to give this document 5 days before December 24? no, obviously. thank you, the Vatican. so, given the comments and DMs that I have on Instagram, I say to myself that it is good to have a slightly longer video. you can see that I am not in my current environment, because during At this time, I'm trying to do my job. so I'm doing itinerant preaching in the diocese, from school to school, I'm slammed, I have 1600 students in the pades, I have three conferences and it will continue all this week. so I'm doing what I can. it's not the usual environment, and what I'm going to do is I 'm going to share with you my real one that I put on Instagram, which is rather well done in my opinion of view, which summarizes my thought, and then I will explain it. and, in the meantime, I thank the Vatican for helping the pastoral effort of the entire Catholic Church to prepare us thus for the fact of the Nativity. thank you the Vatican, the pope, who authorizes the blessing of homosexual couples. what should we think of it and although this new Vatican document, at a given moment, it must be said, is a problem, not in substance but in form. in substance, in fact, it simply says what we already do is to know that there are the sacraments, for example marriage, which was willed to be instituted by Jesus and by God, and that does not correspond to homosexual unions, level below the official liturgical liturgies, which correspond to what is conform to the will of God, and it still does not concern homosexual unions, says the document, and still one level below. and well, everyday conversations, or when you have people, perhaps even couples, who come to ask you to blessing them, the blessing here becomes a request for help, encouragement of purification, because we are not here to break people but to help them, and that is what we already do. so that is where I say that it is a problem in terms of form, because when you produce a document like that, you hold a press conference to explain it. the Vatican refuses to do it, which means that it is non- specialists, who are the journalists who are by of the document, which adds confusion and buzz, and well, that's not how we communicate in the modern world. so, straight away, the first remark I had was in relation to the blessing. I was told I am willing to bathe people, but not couples. ok, but I will give you two examples. there are still cases where it is complicated. so we are not the church, we are simply invited to friends and we understood that you were not there to legitimize or recognize homosexual practice, which, according to the church, is a serious sin period. it will not change for good. but, for example, you have a couple in front of you, homosexual, who is not Christian but who is in the process of converting and who asks you to bless their conversion process. What you want is to immediately tell them: no, there is a problem, you are in a state of serious sin. or, yes, it's good that you discover Jesus and with what love you are loved. well, there. for me, what I do in these cases is that I bless the approach of these people who do it together. I tell them: well, one day we will have a discussion. in the meantime, you are discovering Jesus. it is a beautiful thing, first of all, knowing how we are loved. second scenario: you have a Christian homosexual couple who tells you who is honest, who tells you we, we do what we can. we don't succeed. sometimes we have falls, but we would like to live in a chaste way. I don't want to leave this person because I understood that marriage was not possible. I understood that the practice is was not possible. but there is a kind of affinity and spiritual union between us. there is a kind of affinity of emotional union between us. there are perhaps falls, but I would like us to be blessed for that. God gives us the grace of chastity. but what do you do? well, you bless then. that's where I tell you that, yes, there can be cases where you bless couples. so now, why does that pose so many problems, problem with this affair? well, in fact, it is because, with the way in which the Vatican communicates, we say we no longer know where we are, and I admit that even I, reading the text, et cetera. finally, there is a story which is just we. there are so many documents which seem to contradict each other. so if you want this document, it has been replaced in a whole series of texts. there is first of all the catechism of the Church, which reminds you that it is a serious sin. then you had a document from the dicaster which prohibited the official and solemn blessings of couples. then you had the Belgian bishops who tried to write a ritual for blessing couples. then you had the pope ago 2 years, who reminded that it was a sin. now you have this document there. so, for example, this document which authorizes the blessing of couples, if you ever look at what the Belgian bishops do, it is very conservative. if ever you look now, compared to what the same dicaster did for the faith a few years ago, he is very progressive. and then in the end we no longer know very well what to think, what to think about it. and that This is where I say that, in fact, having a press conference to answer people's questions to accompany the receipt of a document, obviously that's what needs to be donevid. plus, the thing is done 5 days before Christmas. it is published by a dicastery of the faith which normally does not deal with liturgy, which normally does not deal with pastoral, and the document is signed by a cardinal. it is not signed by Francis. so we do not even know if it is the pope, Francis, who speaks or not behind it. we don't even know exactly the degree of authority of this text. so in fact, we are completely unclear. and this is where, in fact, I understand the dismay of the faithful if now I try to get the most out of this document- principles of charity. so I'm a little fed up with transforming myself into the Vatican's sales representative. it would be nice one day to pay for a communications manager, because if I ever managed- like they manage their communication, so excure c is that in a week I could close my channel. finally, here I close the parenthesis. I have come back now. if I try to get the best out of this document, what that tells you anyway is that we don't have the right to demonize lgbtqia people, which can sometimes be a tendency of the church. we do not have the right to demonize because it is not Christian. and we do not have the right to demonize because you have not understood the issues in this case- there the American statistics, in the long term, tell you that 30% of the population is concerned by lgbtqia issues and that in this case, you cannot just say it's a peach tree, even if it's true, it's too reductive and it will cause too much damage. the question becomes too broad. we need to flesh out our speech, and what this document reminds you is that the way in which it must be fleshed out is by recalling, with the requirements of morality, the mercy of God who loves everyone. so now, always to try to make the best of this document- I row a little- is that we now have the framework, we have the two limits. we have a first limit, which is to say the active practice of homosexuality is a sin, and a serious sin. ok, that is in the catechism of the Catholic Church. we are going to say that it is not in this document which tries to say to what extent you have the right to go, who talks about blessing and who tells you you have the right to bless informally if you are ready, as long as it is not a way of endorsing homosexual status. so now we have the two frames, except that it's still very unsatisfactory, because Christian morality cannot be summed up: ah, I have the right, I don't have the right, it's allowed, it's forbidden. there, if you do, if we stick to that, c is a complete short circuit of the Gospel and grace. so now what we are missing is the golden mean, it is virtue, it is the ideal. what do you propose as an ideal to the people who are concerned by these questions of homophily, of homosexuality and so on? what do you offer them as an ideal of emotional fulfillment? and there is still a hole. so I made a video on the question of adelphopoyesis, which I think, in terms of friendship, mysticism, of courteous love, could give an ideal of Christian life to those people who want to live a deep emotional, spiritual union in the path of chastity which is fulfilling. but in any case, what is certain is that now, if we want to get out of this vagueness, it would be good if we finally got away from the forbidden license and gave an ideal of life which allows these people to feel fully Christian and recognized in the church and to have found their place. so we hope that the Vatican finally pays itself a load of com comes down, because at this point it's still just mind-blowing. anyway, here I am. I understand that people are moaning. in the meantime, I'll tell you again that there was no end of this document is still almost Christmas, so get ready for little Jesus who will arrive. life is beautiful, life is beautiful and, above all, love will win.",

        "transcript": "so we said it's Christmas and, as Catholic tradition dictates, and well, Pope Francis, far from all that, will pronounce at noon the traditional blessing ourby and orby. you know it now by force the opportunity can - perhaps to say a word again about what was truly the shock announcement of recent days. yes, homosexual couples will now be able to have a blessing from the church. no liturgical ceremony, on the other hand, but still a blessing. it's still a small earthquake in Catholicism. we are live with Philippe Marsay, auxiliary bishop of Paris. hello, thank you for being live on LCI. so let's already listen a little bit to what the faithful think on microphone stretched in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, at Notre-Dame de l'Assomption de Passi, just before midnight mass yesterday. it is rather necessary for the Church to adapt to the times without denying its fundamental values. the Church should not change drastically and therefore I do not agree with these words of Pope Francis. I find it great that the church adapts and uh manages to accept the decision of others. to allow people to be more comfortable is already a good step forward, but well, afterwards, uh, you have to be really careful to consult and not fall into an ease of accepting everything directly. Philippe Marcel, we see that it still divides the faithful. does it also divide the priests? yes, I think, because that, in fact, the Pope obliges us to deepen a little in the meaning of what we do when we give a blessing. he also obliges us to think about what what we call the sacrament of marriage really is, and that blessing people in an irregular or complicated situation is not validating a status, it is not dedicated to a definitive state of life. it is, it allows them, it is taking into account what they are, uh, in this moment in their history, with a spiritual request, and who and who, if we don't listen to it, uh, risks falling by the wayside. for me, there are three levels that must be clearly distinguished, and that's what creates for me: be careful. either we ignore these people, that is to say, who are in a difficult or irregular situation, and at that moment, we are sure that this is what we do most often in the church and at home. at that point, well, they won't come back, or they won't come back anymore. either we bless them or we consecrate their status, their union, but that's not at all what we want to do. in what the Pope is proposing to us, there is no, that only one single definitive commitment which is consecrated by the Church is called marriage, and it concerns a man and a woman to be able to unite and give and give life. and then there is a intermediate status, which is that of blessing, where we join them in a state of life which is theirs, so that they can progress in their spiritual life precisely. we say anyway, and this is, moreover, what the church says. I will read to you what the church says: it is possible to bless couples in an irregular situation and same-sex couples in a form which does not have to be ritually fixed effectively by the ecclesial authorities, so as not to create confusion with the blessing specific to the sacrament of marriage. this distinction is necessary in order not to annoy those who will still be a little on the line of or on the outdated line. yes, that's it. that is to say that we must not give the impression that we bless a state of life, but that a couple is a story and at a moment in its history we recognize, through an irregularity, that it lives, that there are still good things happening. I give you two examples: the other day I went to prison to celebrate mass and I gave dozens of blessings. I never blessed the crimes or misdemeanors of the prisoners. I blessed h and when I am and when I say to the end of the mass, of all the masses that I celebrate, that I bless all the people who are in the church. I do not ask homosexual people or people in a cohabiting situation to leave. it is just that I tell these people that, at the moment when they are in the search that they have, a person will not come to be blessed if they do not have a spiritual need. and well, this is what the pope asks of us: is to have an ence and a discernment, not to make them believe that we are validating something or to make Catholics believe that we are changing the doctrine, but just that we are accompanying them where they have been for 10 years that the Pope has been Pope. that's exactly how it is, that he guided our pastoral, and it is this conversation which is difficult to live with for priests and probably for many lay people. so, if we try to project ourselves a little bit precisely, is homosexual marriage in the church? do you think that one day we will come there? no, I don't think ever. because the, because the marriage, we the marriage. moreover, it is not homosexual or heterosexual. it is heterosexual, that is to say that you need a man and a woman, otherwise it is not a marriage, and that is why we are not for this name, this word of marriage, nor marriage for all. it is marriage. it is a man and a woman to be able to both unite and give life. so there will be no other question for me. so there, in a few seconds, if you want, there is Father Laurent Julien de Pom roll, priest from Lyon, who announced to his parishioners that he was going to have a child and that, therefore, he was going to have to leave his functions. he said that it's a real upheaval. the marriage of priests is not moving forward. well, it's, it's. I'm not that it's not moving forward. it's that we made a life choice, which is to choose to remain 100% available to God and to men. uh, that the Church's goal is to reinforce one's commitments and not to devalidate something on which a person can do something. we can change things. the proof: well, yes, but it is necessary. this person, this priest, must take responsibility for what he does. but it is. it's not for us to say, it's not for us to say that it's a good thing. it's as if we were saying: well, yes, a divorce is, it's it's a B thing. no, it's, it's a breakup which is painful, and and who and who and who and who doesn't have, and that we should n't, that we shouldn't support.",

I may have discovered a solution. A solution, The solution. I realized after research that the Church had already practiced this solution. So you fasten your seat belt and you dive with me into this hot topic which could call into question a lot of things. Let\u2019s get to the heart of the matter with a quick overview. It\u2019s an observation that everyone makes. we can\u2019t do it. We're going to speak frankly to each other. we're among ourselves. we're not sure it's going to be brilliant this affair. We are at an impasse. There is no shame in recognizing this, Because, in the end, I ended up knowing quite a few committed Christians, both left and right. Yes, we're going to say it anyway. We all made the same observation. We all heard them, these people who came to see us in confession, telling us that they were Christians, that they were doing what they could, but that they couldn't do it. And we, on the other hand, all made the same observation: we felt helpless because we couldn't support them. well, Just telling people that it is a sin is not enough to make them happy. I remind you here that sin is practice, not trends. So on the one hand, there is the Church, which condemns, which does not really propose concrete solutions. On the other hand, there is a kind of over-the-top sexuality that is anything but evangelical Then. well, we are in the middle Now to really understand the problem. look at this graph. This is one of the last polls that was done in the United States. You see that the share of LGBT is relatively low, at 7.5%. but if you dig deeper- that's where it gets interesting- you realize that the new generations identify at 20% as \u201cLGBT\u201d. This means that in the long term- you heard me correctly- there could be one in 5 people who claim to have homosexual tendencies. So let me tell you something. This is because talking about a pastoral impasse is simply not possible. It is not an option, And that\u2019s where ChatGPT comes into the picture. So before complaining about ChatGPT, 2 comments. First of all, it will never replace your good priests or theology studies, because you need to know the Bible and theology well to use ChatGPT well. Two, it is not said. you will see that ChatGPT does less well than certain bishops. So I will introduce ChatGPT to you, then we will look at what the bishops have proposed In Germany, in Belgium, And then we will compare so that you can form your own idea. Anyway, here we go. It's 8 am at the convent and I'm doing a bibliography search with ChatGPT to find references and quotes on a work on homosexuality that I have to do. And then, all of a sudden, by chance, in the dialogue I have with Chat GPT, he offers me this as a reference: \u201cAs John Boswell pointed out in his work \u201cChristianity, social Tolerance and Homosexuality- gay people in Western Europe\u201d. Perhaps you wanted to say something about my accent. I don't think so. we're going back. \u201cThe history of homosexuality in medieval Christianity bears witness to different interpretations and understandings of sexuality\u201d. The Middle Ages, more tolerant than us on the issue. I say to myself: well, I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see. it looks interesting. \u201cAttitudes towards homosexuality were more tolerant than they are now. It presents evidence of same-sex marriage rituals celebrated in some medieval Christian churches\u201d. All the same, I say to myself, ChatGPT is not going to do it for me. I look a little anyway, and it turns out that the Boswell in question was an American academic at Yale University, and that, behind all the rubbish that ChatGPT puts on the screen, we calm down. we have to take it and leave some. There is still something that catches my attention, A rite in Latin called the \u201cordo ad fratres faciendum\u201d. We can't help it: it still always feels more credible when it's in Latin. So I, the guardian of tradition, begin to dig a little deeper into this \u201cordo ad fratres faciendum\u201d And after effective research- thank you theology- I realize that this Latin rite comes, as often happens, from an ancient, forgotten Greek rite: adelphopoiesis. It\u2019s perhaps even fancier when it\u2019s in Greek. This is where it gets really interesting. Adelphopoiesis was an official rite recognized by the Church among Catholics until the 14th century and among Orthodox until the 20th century. It spiritually united two beings of the same sex, but with a depth in the union, an emotional depth of which it is difficult to imagine the power and intensity. There have been pairs of Saints, there have been pairs of holy people, the most famous being Cosmas and Damian, or even Sergius and Bacchusa that you see. on this icon You see their two halos which come together through Christ, the two similar faces to show the emotional and spiritual closeness, And around their neck you see a necklace with keys, which was part of the rite: the exchange of keys. And the exchange of keys probably symbolizes living together. This ceremony took place in a church, since we found rituals with precise formulas of blessing: \u201cSince you, Lord and Sovereign, you are merciful and loving you, who established\u2026\u201d. Those who want to read it in full, you pause. I continue. Now let\u2019s think a little. These works of Bowell in their time caused quite a controversy. I will spare you the details, but what is certain is that adelphopoiesis was much more than a simple fraternal union. Oh no, it was much more complex than that. Pavel Florensky, Orthodox priest, specialist on the subject unknown, states that adelphopoiesis mixed love of charity, love of friendship and erotic love. Love of charity, with this feeling of gratuity, of benevolence. Love of friendship with that trust and affinity from person to person, And erotic love with its sensitive and passionate aspect. Explosive combination. Now, also, be careful: let\u2019s not confuse adelphopoiesis with same-sex marriage. No, no, none of that here, Far from there. Already there can be some very rare cases of adelphopoiesis between men and women. and, above all, it was a bond which was not indissoluble and which had no sexual connotation. That 's you who said it. So, yes, there have been a lot of slip-ups within adelphopoiesis, but I want to say at the same time, given the current situation and given all the slip-ups that we are experiencing at the moment, we can also reasonably think that adelphopoiesis would rather restrict them. So much for adelphopoiesis. Now let's compare this with what some bishops are offering us. In Germany, the national synod asked to recognize homosexual marriage, and in Belgium, the bishops wrote a liturgy blessing homosexual couples. What do you think happened? I don't know. I'll tell you: They got struck by Rome. They took in their gums a responsum of the Congregation for the doctrine of the faith, And that hurts The blessings of same-sex couples. it's nothing, And we understand, because these were pastoral approaches that were far too vague. We made this union look like a marriage, while assuming not to resemble it, while resembling it, While adelphopoiesis is not a sexual union, it is simply something else. It is a deep emotional union and a spiritual union, And it's beautiful. This is another thing. So now, is this hypocrisy A form of homosexuality that does not speak its name? When you look closely at the writings, that\u2019s not the feeling you get, But it is certain that, to see it, we must stop interpreting everything in a sexual way. as soon as we see the slightest expression of sentiment or romantic desire, There is a depth of feeling, an emotional connection that can unite people of the same sex and that can in many ways go beyond the depth of the marital relationship without being based on sexual relations. And yes, that\u2019s also chastity, expanding one\u2019s range of emotional expressions. And, what\u2019s more, that\u2019s what the Bible tells you: 2 Samuel 1:26.. David speaks: \u201cMy heart aches for you, my brother Jonathan. You made me happy. Your love for me was more wonderful than the love of women\u201d. Let me tell you something: When we know David's story, it's not him we're going to suspect of homosexuality, Or 1 Samuel 18, 1:5.. It\u2019s very interesting, because there you have the seeds of this rite of adelphopoiesis: \u201cAnd the soul of Jonathan was joined to the soul of David, And Jonathan loved him as his soul. Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as his soul. Jonathan stripped himself of the coat he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his clothes and even his sword, his bow and his belt\u201d. There you again have a ritual exchange. So what would we gain with adelphopoiesis? This would make it clear once and for all that when the Church condemns the practice of homosexuality, above all it does not want to condemn people to emotional solitude, And that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with the current discourse And with adelphopoiesis, you finally provide a framework for the emotional development of homosexual people, And we better find a good one. I remind you, a fifth of the population. With adelphopoiesis, you give them a mysticism of their own, which is not the marital mysticism but which is that of passionate friendship. You give them a framework in which to practice virtue and chastity. You give them a biblical foundation, You give them models to imitate, holy people, And you offer them a framework that allows them to find a place in the Church without feeling discriminated against and, at the same time, it does not lock them into a role, since adelphopoiesis is flexible. Now, to be completely honest, there are still two things left to see, And: 1, check that the reasons why we stopped practicing adelphopoiesis are not significant. And two, be clear that this is not a worldly ideal but a Christian ideal, And that we will always have to purify our natural tendencies so that we live according to grace and not according to the flesh. Typically, the danger that awaits us in fraternal life, such as religious life, is indifference. There, in adelphopoiesis, the danger would rather be to confuse friendship with intimacy and to transform a privileged relationship into a relationship of exclusivity, That is to say refusing to allow others to open their hearts to other people, Feelings of jealousy, in short, the desire for possession, which will probably always need to be purified. But grace exists In fact. why is it hard to imagine? This is because, since the 19th century and the ultra-romantic conception of marriage, each time now that there is a certain form of emotional intensity, we interpret that in terms of sexuality And in fact we don't realize it. but our sentimental vocabulary has become extremely limited compared to past generations. In short, I say it\u2019s a try: Take care of yourself, Love will win.",

          "So what can I say, the 20% is not surprising. A lot of homosexuals don&#39;t admit it, live hidden and cheat on their families. Go to a dating site and you'll quickly realize this. The vast majority are married &quot;Hetrocurious people&quot;. Societal acceptance means that this large hidden percentage is out in the open for all to see. This is a fact. Of course there&#39;s also a percentage of fashion too. Then, for all those against, what's your solution? If you don&#39;t propose a way of life and sweep what bothers you under the carpet, the derives come and in tempest. Refreshing sexual urges for a lifetime 90% of people here are incapable of doing so. Suggesting a way of uniting, loving and giving affection to each other that doesn&#39;t involve sexuality is a way of softening this path and enabling fulfillment. Then what happens in the intimacy of two people is their business and God&#39s. I read &quot;LGBT ideology&quot;, so you have to understand that some people don&#39;t adhere to it but are nonetheless attracted to the same sex. I&#39;m a homosexual, I refused to practice it by accepting Jesus in my heart and in my life. He is my ultimate love and I know fundamentally that he wishes my good above all else and that my path is a thousand times more blessed on the path of love and possible union than in an advitam eternam restriction that could cause me suffering. Maybe that&#39;s not the case, the Lord&#39;s ways are impenetrable, but being able to choose is important. Free will is essential to faith. Virtue doesn&#39;t apply when others constrain us, but when we guide our actions with heart and reason rather than by non-possibility. A murderer who doesn&#39;t kill because he&#39;s straitjacketed for life is still a murderer, the one who overcomes his impulse and repents with free will is saved. So stop acting as Christ's sword arm to apply what you understand of his law. He doesn&#39;t need you to reign. Amen",

          "Personally, I wonder if nature, and I mean nature, created homosexuals, because homosexuality has existed since the dawn of time, and we can see it in animals too...

I don't know, I wonder and ask myself a lot of questions..., because medicine is fighting so that we can live as long as possible and many people would like to be immortal, in short... And then there are some men and women who want children as homosexuals, why?

It&#39;s the Practice that Human beings judge since God would have said love each other, marry, be Faithful and have Children but we are ALL sinners already so whether we practice sex or not, even solo, it can be a way to strengthen bonds and solo to be able to de-stress from a bad day, as long as we don&#39;t abuse it and then it&#39;s very intimate the practice...<br>And I'll just finish with this, if God really wanted us to be &quot;perfect&quot; then why can't some people have d&#39;Children for such and such a reason?

        "transcript": "[Music], a delicate question on the continent that we are going to discuss with Fran\u00e7ois Mabi, good evening. good evening, you are director of the Geopolitical Observatory of Religions within the Iris. so the Catholic bishops of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire are opposed. they were united yesterday in yamouscro and they asked the priests to refrain from blessings of same-sex couples and couples in an irregular situation. a response which was predictable. yes, it was predictable, because we know very well that the Catholic Church in general is very divided on this question. question there, during the synod on synodality. it is this great gathering that the Pope has wanted in recent years on the subject of major subjects which cross the Catholic Church and of a corresponsibility. we have clearly seen that the bishops could not take a position on this subject because they were too divided. when we are talking about blessing and not about marriage actually, which shows that there is undoubtedly a deficit in pedagogy and explanation of the text, because this text does not say that the Catholic Church recognizes neither homosexual marriage nor homosexuality as such. what the pope is proposing is simply support for people who are, I would say, outside the norm of the Church. Catholic is outside the norm. outside the norm, it means that not only homosexuals? yes, absolutely. it is that, for the Catholic Church, a traditional anthropology, a couple is a man, a woman. therefore, sexuality and sexuality in the marriage, the in the couple, the couple being united by marriage. therefore, no divorced couple. therefore, no remarried divorced couple, no sexuality before marriage and outside the conditions defined by the Catholic Church and indeed, no couple which is homosexual. and therefore, It is to these people that the Pope is addressing by saying: the Church must take into account the fact that many people today, throughout the world, do not live according to the standards of the Catholic Church and therefore, what do we do for these people? do we condemn them, do we accompany them or do we ignore them? he offers to accompany them. uh, moreover, he said in 2013: the pope, if a person is gay and seeks the Lord, who am I to judge it? pe, that the idea, all yes, exactly, with undoubtedly a kind of ambiguity in this pope, who had, at the same time, these words that you recalled. we could give other examples and then, in other situations- I am thinking in particular of his last trip to Hungary- or in front of Victor Orban, very critical on these questions, the Pope recalled the traditional doctrine of the church on the family and also took up his way the criticisms of orthodoxy against Western Europe, decadence. so you see, this ambiguity there, this lack of clear line today finds an outcome in the tensions that we see. so we do not touch the sacrament of marriage, obviously. then we heard in the subject the reverend theologian Grapr\u00e9 say that the pope wants to give a chance to all those who are outside the doctrine. this is not understandable either. let's say that there is a deficit of, of, of of pedagogy. the report that you showed is very interesting. you have a person who takes up arguments which are not those in fact proposed by the pope, and therefore we clearly see the difference between the text as it was promulgated and, undoubtedly, moreover, in a somewhat abrupt manner. there would undoubtedly have been a need for an explanation before the publication of this text, rather than an explanation of the text after these names. in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire- so we saw it, but also in the DRC, we will listen to the archbishop of Kinshasa. the problem is not the condemnation of these people. we must respect them. people have the right to be treated with respect, with compassion, with delicacy, but homosexuality nevertheless remains a moral disorder which is contrary to natural law and to our African culture, vo\u00e0 homosexuality, contrary to our African culture. it is the archbishop of Kinshasa who says it. it is a sentence that we often hear, but what is it really? but it is interesting because this clearly shows the difficulty for the Catholic Church to keep a word which is universal. and indeed there are cultural differences. there are differences, I say, of priority, also political. in a certain way, we could say that what the The Pope encounters a difficulty on this subject, it is also what he encountered a few months ago when he came to France to talk about immigration, and this time on migrants. it was mainly Christians and Catholics from the North who were against his word. so you see, this difficulty in keeping a universal word is found there on this subject, and we must not forget that. in Africa, but it is not only in Africa- a certain number of countries condemns homosexuality, therefore the Catholic Church. it is also caught in a public ethics, in laws which sometimes constrain it. then it is a practice, the diiction, which already exists in certain countries of the North. does that mean that the Pope conceded to the request of the countries of the North but not necessarily, uh, to the request of the rest of the world? yes, it is part of the ambiguities in his speech. I told you the synod- this gathering of bishops did not take place- pronounced on the subject. we could have waited for the pope to finally or publish a document later and after a consultation, rather than imposing this type of document in a somewhat unilateral manner. so there is undoubtedly a problem in the governance of the Catholic Church. indeed, Franis May thank you.

Same-sex marriage and same-sex marriage 2. Now there have been many voices saying that if it is not a black crime to legislate, it should be interpreted as possible even now. Anyway, it is possible to see same-sex marriage together. Then we will do this again, and the change in society is also a change in the economy. If we gather together, we become colleagues. Then, in order to become people, we followed suit by purchasing the goods that we used to use, the service. That's why we asked for it. It's not the 4th industrial revolution in the future of the Korean economy, but it's a field that will emerge once the same-sex marriage rumor is legislated. The economy is queer studies. Don't go to the phone game with the Korean economy. It does n't seem like the distant future anymore. At some point. I've Do it, It will be done. Danjeon 2. It's so hard and painful. Every time I hear it. you go to see what Joseph came to see The malicious application notice was a shaman Park Soo-soo. He said: don't worry, because it was so painful. It was just like that before people came forward. What did he say then? Don't worry, Ah, same-sex marriage will be legalized in 8 years. Am I someone who is occasionally with others? NME is worried about the future, but same-sex marriage will be legalized. The perverts gathered together. So in 2017, it has been about 8 years, I think Article 18 and 10 places have been here. It seems like it will come out in about 4 years. So, since we only have 4 years left, you have to prepare for the stock market. If you stick a bullet for 4 years, you will become a doctor. The media is divided into related stocks and the stages are related stocks, so they don't like marriage yet, that is, they don't group, but they buy 7 times one by one, and the most talked about article about the wedding industry is going down the road. In the meantime, if it is applied to same-sex marriage, this will not deteriorate. Give me Ocean 2.. I looked at Gartner on SNS. Even if you are not legally married, you are a partner and anxiety during marriage is a gauge for couples. Yes, if you look at the reviews of those couples. in the case of the October market, you can just sell products Because of this. they may be interfering with their own personal prejudices. If they just say that they will marry my partner and proceed with three, they will look at it next year and not even ask if it is a girl or anything like that. So they say things like that a lot. Even the naturalists themselves are all created by Satan so that people can raise a lot of money. So in the United States, same- sex marriage is now legalized and these things are all short and rising. Why do you ask me to take donations and make a living like this? I don't know if I will have any experience in my life or not, but I think I don't want to do it because of the time I have to get married. Well, but I heard that they say they can raise money for same-sex marriage and that they do n't stamp it. so that's not the case. I'm going to do it. but even if I look at it, it's like that once. 1. Why should I like it in the fall of Edin? I wish I could roll it. Should I make the first prize for excessive drinking? I saw a post about a very interesting patch on Facebook a while ago and it seems like you have a same-sex lover. Now the same-sex lover keeps packing 2 people like this and posts various photos of things like rings and huh. I promised to buy some. He sent me a performance and put it in Jongro again. I can do it. I can read 2 metal and wear it with various things like gun No 2.. I can love the shoulder, because there is such a thing and I actually experience it, You know. but from that moment on, I know people are ordering because they say they want to do something that is a step up from what they are critical of. but I raised it 1 order more than others. It's giving because marriage is like that? Well, I don't think so. I don't know. if it's sucking, so do it. The industry is actually very connected to this kind of marriage. I also majored in music and wrote about this topic, so when I was in college, the most interesting thing was the wedding. Ayala, which is a part-time job for a lot of medical students who are sexy- Are you not giving thanks to students and holidays by grinding it and sucking out the nutrients Code? Ah, if you are forced to become a monk. it will fall 10 times more. It will be downloaded more. Now, what time and what time is written like this. Then they take a day off and stay still at the wedding hall and continue filming. The same goes for me. Are you a music student or a film student? Those people are so salty that they take care of the people's livelihood. It's a prophecy. Try doing what you were doing. It becomes more visible and you have no choice but to do more. and because it is that big people have no choice but to look at the money. Yes, on the one hand, I think that all relationships are good for movies, but on the other hand, it seems like it is a fact that I have not written down. To be honest, let's get married. I'm thinking about doing it too. It's done in a completely drunken state. Ah, the actual kid writes like this and goes to the business and, yes, beggar Sand Island. If you pay for the wedding, it's not because you live in the drama, But people just stop and do the same thing. You know, before this relationship burns out, I make an effort to see what happens.

Shows say that, but they can do it and they can't. Being able to choose this and not being able to choose in a situation where you can't do it at all are completely different. So if I could, I would have chosen not to do it or to do it and then get divorced. but in a situation where it's not my choice, I'm trying not to give up my grave. Pick it up. You're probably making fun of me, So so bad people have to come. Now I've put less humanity into your 10,000.. I've tried you, so I'll write about it someday. so I'm saying that Now, anyway, queer people just want to live by doing what other people do. so the world is a little better. I wish it was different. Yes, this has changed so much. It takes too long, It's a little bit. It's not good. It's diversification, But you can trust him. The core enemy is, Anyway, as society undergoes great upheaval, stable foundations are collapsing and there are parts like this: How to establish that stable foundation at that time? I have still thought that if Korean society adopts the second nuclear family system, legalization of health may be one of the ways to expand the population in order to maintain the system until that year. I 'm thinking of asking you if you can achieve it by walking this tightrope together. but sometimes it happens. Where do couples go and get married? How many times have they tried to get married but it did n't work out and it broke down. But how many times have you gone through this process?

        "transcript": "7555. 5. Not long ago, two people from the National Health Insurance Corporation were now recognized as spouses by the government. Could you tell us a little bit about that story? First of all, there is an explanation of the system. 4: I am Goseong Ok, an employee subscriber. It is classified as a local subscriber. In that case, it must now be used as a local subscriber and the G title must be separately treated. In fact, in Korea, if you say such an opposite-sex couple, only one of them is an employee subscriber and the spouse is also a dependent of the employee subscriber at that time. I am now in a position to provide guidance. This person was now paying separate local insurance premiums and in the meantime, I heard that now you can enjoy the same benefits even if you are in a common-law marriage. Not being in a common-law marriage is really not that big of a deal, but living together under it We have plans to maintain a relationship with each other and we just need to satisfy a few conditions. 3. In fact, the fact that homosexuality is not allowed on campus is too big, so we are thinking of applying for a common-law marriage. Yes, during the application process we didn't know. just in case, We are very familiar with this page. so when we apply for this, I wonder if I will be able to do it. We are not even in a relationship with the B type. We are a same-sex couple, so we are not married, but we are trying to apply as a common-law relationship. Is it possible? The answer was that it was possible, so they told us everything about the process. I applied as you told me and I chose a replacement. Ah yes, that's how I get a spouse recognized by the country. So the reason why we want to make our relationship known is for you to know as well. We wanted to share our story through media interviews because we wanted to make it easier for people to enjoy their rights. But will the media now cover it? That's right. It's the first time I've seen the costs handled so quickly, in just two or three hours. Ah 2. For the first time in a while, an employee called me and said he personally handled our issue. He called me to confirm that it was him and he didn't know that we were a same-sex couple. They canceled it on the very same day, Even though they were a same-sex couple. they showed their same-sex identity. Oh, so I also think it's a very strange excuse. When we applied, there was a family relationship certificate among the documents, so each of us ended up with a gender: M, M. It is written like this. So does that mean that they just processed it without looking at it? But that doesn't mean that even when entering the resident registration number, we also start with two legs. so why did they process it? I wonder why that person processed it. He kept saying things like \" I didn't know they were same-sex\" and he only said things like this. I thought he was actively filing a lawsuit against Woo. 4. After that, our relationship went back to just a domestic partner relationship. It's not allowed from the first application for a child. I would have known that I couldn't face rejection like this. 4. It happened once, and then, after 8 months of doing the same, I got even more angry because I was unilaterally seeing-sawed like this. That's why I felt so strongly that they were trying to take away our rights. They said it was a lawsuit they were looking for, and now they have started a lawsuit. This health insurance should be given to you if you just apply, but isn't that true for marriage registration? Well, it's not like the country is declining. Isn't there an item that says same-sex couples are not allowed. Also, a little bit about that. What do you think? Kim Jo Kwang-soo and Kim Seung-hwan in the first game applied for a marriage registration at the Seodaemun District Office, but there was an incident where the pigment was added. At that time, what the district office received was the term \"Sweet Beopsa Couple\" and the part consisted of husband and wife. I refused, saying it couldn't be done, But in fact we already use the word 'couple'. 4. Hey, I think language can actually change with the times. For example, in the days when women didn't have the right to vote citizens, When they said this, women were not citizens. Now, when someone says they are citizens, women don't have perms, right, I think the language is changing. and some people say that same-sex relationships are illegal in Korea, but there is no statue anywhere. I don't like the prohibition of the law, but there is definitely a clause prohibiting spells or playing on the bench. It's not me, but it's a coolant. There are marriages in areas that are clearly prohibited in that way, but the character is not like that. so same-sex sex is also possible Now under our civil law. why is that like that? And another thing is that the constitution now has a part about both sexes and by both sexes. it doesn't mean the opposite sex, It's just two sexes and there's no need to interpret that to mean the opposite sex. Even under the Constitution, this voice actor is fully possible. There is no need to tear down and amend this law. Does this differ in interpretation? [Music] 2. Another recent case is Sayuri's broadcast. and even though Mr Society is empty, I want to give birth now and I want to breastfeed. You did it because you said that, but you said it wasn't a picture of a healthy family. Don't air it on TV. It was supposed to be a parenting TV program, but you opposed it one after another, as the broadcast was responsible for showing a picture of a healthy family, even raising a marriage proposal to the public. Even if it's just me and someone else is having a baby, they say it's not healthy and in fact, this dad also said that it's a family of four. When I looked it up, I found that only about 16% of the people were 4 or 5331.. The remaining 84% of people were all there. Why are attempts like this still happening? Can people think more about it and think it is natural to make such attempts? I just think about it simply because it is easy for the state to control. That family of four is just right. If you deviate from that framework, you have to think a little more and think a little more diversely, and you just have to think of the family of four as a normal and enemy. that is really easy to control. I think that the systems have been created in that way. In fact, as you said earlier, it is only 16%. I think that means the system is chasing after reality. so I think there should be a change to keep up with this trend. The Kojo system has been around for almost 50 years. While something existed like an immutable law in Korea, it was abolished In the era of the pen. the country was ruined. They say that a country that disappears will fail. Now drink it and give it to your senior. The color of the heart that will be given to you is Agatha, and it is formed in the future. 4. So that health, that walkie vnd. After registering, I was listed as a spouse. 5 times that amount and the National Health Insurance Corporation wrote that I am now a family member. I think 8 months is enough to fly away. Ah well, if you are in a hurry to have a baby. why actually? I was talking about social DC earlier, but I am in a mansion. What else can we do? And now the petition is up and let's get it. We should just appear there, Because if the goal is to show a healthy family, an error that has never been done before, like we do now, will occur, and it must be a woman and a man. In fact, health is always better, but it seems to be used in such a sweet way. What is waste and what is healthy? Who decides and who does not have to judge? I think it is an important issue. So really, the two of us live equally emotionally, mentally, physically and sexually. As I said earlier, if you live with happiness and satisfaction, it is really healthy if you live dependently, but there are many opposite-sex couples that someone has decided and if you don't get divorced and survive, you can't live normally. Otherwise it is unhealthy and broken. I think it is very important to be here like an unhappy family. [ [Music]. Thank you. I will continue with Part 2 of Marty. I hope to see more of [ __ ]. Thank you, That's right.",

        "transcript": "Oh, which country in the world was the first to legalize same-sex marriage? It was the Netherlands. Same-sex marriage was legally recognized in 2000.. The Netherlands is a representative, open country that allows not only same-sex marriage but also prostitution, and Marie and Me- A total of 31 so far The country has legalized it. The culture of recognizing same-sex marriage is becoming a reality in Western churches. This is because these countries first legalized same-sex marriage and churches are also accepting same-sex marriage. [Music]. Recently, the British Methodist Church approved same-sex marriage As the union recognizing It was decided to accept the Dong-song marriage by an overwhelming margin of 254 in favor and 46 in opposition. At the general meeting, an opinion was expressed that defining the life-long union of the body, mind and soul of two people after marriage was passed, and this was passed. Regarding this decision, the Methodist Church Pastor Carolyn Lawrence, who served as supplementary president, told the source that the pastor was planning to withdraw from the Methodist Church or resign as a member. Today is the day we left the doctrine we believe in and drew the line. The British government announced in July 2013 that same-sex The legalization of marriage has been in effect in England and Wales since 2014.. In addition to the British Methodist Church, it appears that it has inevitably opened its doors to this social trend. According to British media such as the Guardian and BBC, in the UK, Quaker Unitel and Ian Chong's Free Christian Church Scotland has become a successful United Church of Remembrance and is now recognizing same-sex marriage. The Church of England has not yet officially permitted it, but calls for tolerance are increasing within the Church of England. On July 2,, Bishop Paul Bays of the Diocese of Liverpool said that the Church of England should support gender equality. It is argued that same-sex couples should be blessed by adopting preparatory conversion. Churches in each country have also slowly begun to recognize same-sex marriage. The Presbyterian Church (USA), the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America (USA), the Evangelical Lutheran Church (USA) and the United Church of Christ (USA) have also recognized them, as has the United Methodist Church (USA). A plan was also announced to disadvantage conservative denominations that insist on maintaining the denomination's traditions and progressive denominations that accept sexual minority policies. Nine churches in Sweden- the French Protestant Church, the Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Church and others- allowed officiating same-sex marriages, and the Canadian Chapter's alma mater allowed same-sex marriages. The ordination of homosexuals was allowed and same-sex defense was allowed at the Australian Institute of Education. At the time, the definition of marriage was revised to human union, Then why did churches take advantage of same-sex marriage? Jeong Il-kwon, former visiting professor at Soongsil University's Graduate School of Christian Music, said: 7. I see it as the influence of the secularization of the church. Scholars are trying very hard to find it in the Bible, but in fact it started right away as the influence of Foucault. So the church is a queer theology. I ca? n't find the basis within the church's lower Bible. This is a gaunt church. I see it as Gnosticism. That's right. There are many scholars who analyzed it that way, many scholars, many lawmakers and many lawmakers. but this church gave in. Currently, the churches that accept same-sex marriage are Seoul Law and the American Church. There is strong resistance to same-sex marriage and sexual revolution in churches in Eastern Europe, Brazil and other countries in South America, Asia and Africa. Most churches around the world are adhering to the biblical principles secured by the Roman Catholic Church. The Roman Catholic Church is also officially. The church's recognition of same-sex marriage is not a global trend because it opposes homosexuality. The Bible is clear that marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman- Chapter 2, 24, 30. Marriage is when a man leaves his parents and unites with his wife- Church history. 1 Corinthians and Ephesians also say that marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman. The church has always been challenged by new cultures and trends since 2,000 years ago, but each time it returned to its roots and pursued a more biblical church and faith. The church must not be shaken and must quietly walk the path taught by the Lord. [Music].",

          "Catholic Church Teachings on Homosexuality \u2764 Excessive hatred and condemnation of homosexuality is undesirable, and man cannot condemn man, for it is the teaching of the Lord that if you condemn, you are condemned. On June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled by a vote of five out of nine justices that four states' anti-same-sex marriage laws were unconstitutional, bringing attention to homosexuality and same-sex marriage.  In its ruling, the Supreme Court declares that marriage is profound because it \"embodies the highest ideals of love trust commitment sacrifice and family\" and that these people are asking for it because they honor those ideals, giving them the right to the \"equal dignity before the law\" they are asking for. <BR><BR>In response, Archbishop Joseph Kurtz, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, called the Supreme Court's ruling \"a tragic error\" and emphasized that \"Catholics must hold to the immutable truth of the Catholic Church, which recognizes marriage as between one man and one woman.\" \"Like the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion 40 years ago, this decision is not rooted in truth, and as a result, both will ultimately fail,\" he said.\"<BR><BR>It is entirely predictable, however, that the Catholic Church's position on homosexuality and marriage will continue to be challenged. Calls for same-sex unions to be given the same legal status as male-female marriages are already being heard in many parts of the world, and South Korea is no exception. Since the Netherlands became the first country to legalize same-sex marriage in 2001, 17 countries around the world have fully recognized same-sex unions, citing the right of individuals to pursue happiness and equality. In South Korea, filmmakers Kim Jo Kwang-soo and Kim Seung-hwan's same-sex wedding in September 2013 sparked a social controversy, and they are currently suing to have their marriage legally recognized. In June and July, the city centers of Seoul and Daegu hosted \"Queer Culture Festivals,\" festivals of sexual minorities, which were hotly debated between pro-gay rights and conservative stances on marriage. <br><br> <br><br>\u2764The Church recognizes homosexuality as an \"objective disorder\" but not a sin<br><br> <br><br>There are many theories and debates about whether the cause of homosexuality is innate and biological or acquired and socially and culturally learned, but no one knows for sure. Early studies concluded that homosexuality is inherited through scientific evidence, such as twin studies, but later studies were found to be biased against homosexuals or lacked objective evidence. However, the Kinsey Report in the United States in 1948, which showed that a significant number of people experience homosexuality, shook the myth that homosexuality was a mental illness, and in 1973 the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses. The Catholic Church also recognizes that some people are attracted to the same sex against their will, and says that people with same-sex attraction are dignified human beings and should not be unfairly discriminated against. However, it is clear that homosexual behavior - sexual acts between people of the same sex - is morally unacceptable.<BR><BR>The Catholic Church's teaching on homosexuality is made clear in the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith's 1975 Declaration on Certain Problems of Sexual Ethics and its 1986 Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexuals, as well as in paragraphs 2357-2359 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church and paragraph 228 of the Compendium of Social Teaching. <BR><BR>The Catholic Church defines homosexuality as an \"objective disorder\" or \"intrinsic disorder\" that is contrary to natural law, based on teachings found in several places in the Bible (Genesis 19 1-11; Leviticus 18 22; Leviticus 20 13; 1 Corinthians 6 9; Romans 1 18-32) (Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2357-8). The Church recognizes that having a homosexual orientation is not a sin, but it is a powerful inclination toward an intrinsic ethical evil, and therefore the orientation itself is an \"objective disorder\" (Pastoral Letter on Homosexuality, n. 3). <BR><BR>The Church further emphasizes that there is a natural law order in which God created human beings as male and female and intended the sexual union of man and woman. The Catechism of the Catholic Church emphasizes that the sexual act of giving oneself completely to another is permissible only within the marriage of a man and a woman, and that \"in the bodily union of the couple, the two purposes of marriage are realized: the good of the couple themselves and the transmission of life\" (no. 2362). In particular, the mutual union of a man and a woman in marriage results in a physical, spiritual, and symbolic complementarity that cannot be achieved in a same-sex union. <BR><BR>The Church therefore sees same-sex sexual activity as a violation of God's original design for sexual union within marriage, which is the mutual unity of man and woman and the transmission of life. Furthermore, homosexual behavior undermines the call to transmit life and to give oneself completely, because it has \"a fundamentally arrived sexual tendency of self-indulgence\" (Pastoral Letter on Homosexuality, no. 7). Therefore, the Church says that calls to give same-sex unions the \"status of marriage\" are highly absurd, and that the human person can only reach completion through integral unity and psychophysical mutual perfection in the union of two persons of different sexes (Brief Social Teaching 228).<BR><BR>\u2764Excessive hatred and condemnation of homosexuality undesirable<BR><BR>Of course, homosexuals have the inherent dignity of all human beings, which must always be respected in word and law, and violence and discrimination against them must be condemned. The Catholic Church recommends that people should treat them with respect, compassion, and kindness because their situation is often a trial, and homosexual Christians are encouraged to recognize that they are called to realize God's will in their lives and to share in the Lord's sacrifice on the cross through all the difficulties of their situation, which means that they, too, are called to chastity as Christians (Canon 2358, Pastoral Letter to Homosexuals, paragraph 12).   <BR><BR>To summarize, since homosexuality is an objective disorder and homosexual behavior is an unethical act that violates natural law and the created order, those with homosexual orientation should pursue a different way of life, namely chaste love, as opposed to sexual behavior. The Church also teaches that homosexual behavior and homosexual persons should be distinguished and accepted with tolerance, not discriminated against. <BR><BR>Thus, excessive hatred and condemnation of homosexuality is undesirable. The Pastoral Letter to Homosexuals warns against generalizing judgments from individual cases, pointing out that homosexual orientation is not a sin in itself, and that homosexual acts are not sinful if the person has no other choice and lacks freedom (paragraph 11).<BR><BR>Today, with the growing sensitivity to the human rights of LGBT people and the prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation as an international standard, some Christians may be tempted to allow excessive homophobia to overshadow the will of God, who loves all human beings unconditionally. If we remember that Jesus Christ befriended prostitutes and tax collectors, who were considered sinners in his day (even though the Pharisees and scribes condemned them), it is clear that the attitude of Christians today towards those who fall outside of the Church's teachings, including homosexuals, should be one of compassion and acceptance rather than condemnation and exclusion. Let us remember what Pope Francis told reporters in 2013 during an interview with a news organization. \"If a person who is homosexual seeks God with a good will, who am I to judge him?\"<br><br>&lt;Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful,&gt; \u2720 The Holy Gospel as preached by Luke (6,36-38) 36 Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.<br>37 Do not judge others, and you will not be judged.<Do not condemn others, and you will not be condemned.<br>38 Forgive, and you will be forgiven.<br>39 Give, and you will receive.<br>Press, shake, and overflow, and it will be given to you in abundance.<br>For in the same measure that you measure, it will be measured to you.\"<br><br>This is the word of the Lord.<br>\u25ce Christ be praised.",

        "transcript": "[Music]. Reporter Park Hyun-kyung. In. Inside America, the issue of women's vocations becomes quite sensitive, especially when it comes to religion. Today's LA Times highlighted a religious denomination that is experiencing conflict due to this. Hello Reporter Park Hyun-kyung. Hello, Christian denominations are separated in the 1st period. There is news that this is a crisis and Nathan-related issues often cause couples to separate. It is by far not only couples that cause separation, but religion is now also included. 1. The LA Times reported today that denominations are seriously considering separation. There is a month, Then. which Christian denomination is attempting to separate because of a specific sexual issue? The one that is considering separation is the Protestant United Methodist Church. The reason it is not considering separation is because of same-sex marriage and LG's BT Q. 2 weeks of sexual minorities- Opinions on this will be discussed now- and there are many sexual minorities who believe in Christianity and go outside, but surprisingly, there are many later. But then an issue arose and the conflict is deepening. Um, but the comparison with Yuna is a big one. Is it agitation? 4: Christian. In terms of Christianity, it is the third largest Christian church in the United States following the Catholic season and Southern Bell Test File. In terms of Protestant tantrums, it is the second largest. It has about 13 million church members worldwide and the United States There are about 6.5 million people, which is half of that number. However, the third-largest Protestant church is receiving considerable attention from the church as the second-largest major denomination is splitting off. However, while reporting this news, 1tym interviewed a Korean pastor. 4 At the head of the article. there was an interview with Pastor Jonathan Park of the Korean United Methodist Church, and Pastor Park said that no one is happy about separation or celebrates it. At least I certainly am. It's clear, but I think this is something that can't be helped. Pastor Bob Rose of Percy 100 Beach Me Nick, who is close to Pastor Park, also agreed with Pastor Bang. He said he hoped they could get along well, but when he was asked this question, he said his thoughts changed a bit. If he was counseling a couple where one person was being abused by the other, would he advise them to continue living together? Pastor Lee said that in the end, both couples would feel that they were being abused by the other person, but they also agreed to separate. The Methodist Church said: \"Yoona 122 of the Every Forest Haggard Show: Why is this here and there\". There are a lot of premonitions. this year too. There are a lot of things in the church, but the debate about Christianity is already a long time ago. Yes, it goes back almost 50 years, in March 1900.. At that time, homosexuality was not compatible with Christian teachings. There was an announcement from this church that it could not be done, So since that announcement, the issue of homosexuality and sexual minorities has been bubbling up as a desire. Then, recently, same-sex marriage was allowed and policies to embrace sexual minorities were gradually implemented, increasing the conflict. 4. But it is said that there was a special reason for the separation of this United Methodist Church. One of the pastors was a sexual minority. The pastor was a member of the United Methodist Church and Pastor Playdell was the director of i5 Ada iwell Slender on this campus. 2. Reverend Blades took the lead in the movement to ordain gay pastors within the denomination, allowed same-sex marriage and even permitted marriage in the home. However, as same-sex marriage became more legalized, pastors who claimed to be homosexual or maintained a same-sex marriage despite belonging to the Methodist Church began to be revealed. Coming out in the religious world was published in a volume called La Blade. The pastor also attended the Iowa Annual Conference in June 2016 and accused himself of being homosexual. Now the Institute for Religion and Democracy, a lobbying group that strives to protect the traditionalist values \u200b\u200badvocated by conservative Protestants, has appointed Blade's pastor to the annual conference investigation committee. 4: 2. The investigative committee has been pushing for the indictment of the pastor. Then, at a special general meeting held last year, the United Methodist Church adopted a traditionalist plan banning ordination of homosexuals and same-sex marriage, and now they are talking about separation. However, in the suburbs, I was actually already choosing a policy of separation. Yes, that's right. the United Methodist Church officially announced a policy of separating churches on the 3rd. Leaders from various countries, including the United States, Europe, Africa and the Philippines, attended Washington DC. They held a mediation meeting at the Ahn Law Office and decided on the same policy. Since they have been showing different opinions since 1972, we thought it was right to unite Then. isn't it okay for us to think that they have separated now? In the case of Methodist Church 6, it is almost over now. Among the details of the negotiations are how the church's financial assets will be distributed and how the separation process will be established. These details will be decided in more detail in the future and the final decision will be made at the international conference held at Mine Place in May, It goes through approval. There are a lot of people who pass or fail to pass here If they reach final adulthood like this, the United Methodist Church will separate the denomination and denomination 48 years after the discussion began in 1972, putting an end to whether or not it embraces sexual minorities. Therefore, each church now has its own inclination. Should I decide whether to stay here or leave? 4. The original United Methodist Church became a denomination that accepted homosexuality and in the future, a new branch called the Traditionalist Methodist Church was created, and now not only same-sex marriage but also sexual proposals for homosexuals are banned in New York. So it seems that progressive churches that support same-sex marriage will be able to become more liberal churches, as conservative groups leave, while churches that have opposed the acceptance of homosexuality will have to become independent and leave to join this traditionalist Methodist branch. Among those who are single, there are a lot of people who go to this Methodist Association. Yes, I am really curious about how the Korean United Methodist Church will respond At this time. the advice that should be given in the Korean church to leave is to choose. If you look around, you can see a lot of this traditionalism, especially in the Korean church world. Last week, the lay executive committee of the Western Korean United Methodist Church belonging to the United Methodist Church held a meeting. There are now 350 Korean churches belonging to the United Methodist Church. across the country. There are about 10 of them, and they predicted that the direction would move towards traditionalism. This was a policy based on the results of a survey conducted last year, so most churches now hold polls to ask church members for their opinions, and the results are as follows. It is expected that a decision will be made depending on the gender identity. However, there will be people who have a strange sexual identity and some who will remain. They are not moving toward separation. Yes, but if they first move out of separation, will their names have to change again? Yes, compare the impressions. Is it not an island word order? Should we do it quickly like this? Hey, but when we think about common sense, I think the normal way is for the traditional cold or 4 to remain, and then the church that supports acceptance in the 4 to 4 east. I don't have that experience either. 4, That's how many people are in favor of it than those who are leaving. so the 60-line header comes out like this: Oh, that's right. 5, That's right. I know that most of the churches are now known to say no, What and where is this left? I wonder if it will also become a hot topic. Yes, even in the handle there is a lot of confusion and there seems to be some separation. on top 4. Sign language is good. I am in charge of Egg. It was reporter Park Hyun-kyung. [Music].",

        "transcript": "The two smile as they are, greeted with warm applause. A wedding that I thought would never happen. [ Music]. The song to say farewell made me feel emotional Fluttery. [Music] Just the right amount. A little bit of curry too, More crunch: Fukujinzuke Kemono, let's go. Yes, it's delicious. Mr Kaneshige Hirata and Mr Kohei Katsuyama- The two of them, who call each other Kanecofe, have been dating for 11 years. They see each other quite a bitDepending on the day, one of them may stay overnight for work. However, since I retired, I am excited to go out with the two of us for the first time like thisI am really enjoying the time we have togetherWhen we met, Mr Kane was working at the Osaka City Fire Department and Mr Coffe was a firefighter at the Kyoto Prefectural Police Department. He was a police officer in charge of victim support in the Kyoto Animation arson murder case. Both men hid the fact that they were gay at work. They felt like they couldn't tell, even if their mouths were torn apart, and there was no real benefit to coming out. On the contrary, we have a fear that if someone finds out, everything we've worked hard for will be taken away. and when it comes to talking about our private lives, we have this switch that we don't want people to find out, so we lose our boyfriends to girlfriends. There are some people who have to have complicated conversations and convey information, or who have seniors pick up their smartphones and look at them without permission, or who do it while laughing. Mr Coffe felt this fear from the age of nine, when he realized he was gay. At the time, the character Yasuke Oda, who mocked homosexuals on TV, was popular among his classmates. It became a hot topic and my friends imitated that strong character and everyone started laughing about how disgusting it was. and then, when I got home and watched TV with my family, I started talking about how disgusting it was. I was afraid that if I were to break up, I would be the target of bullying or people would think I was a pervert or that I would be seen as a disgusting, abnormal person. so even when I became an adult, that ingrained fear never went away. Mr Coffe kept working as a police officer, but his health deteriorated and three years ago he was diagnosed with an adjustment disorderThis led to the two of them resigning from their jobs of over 10 yearsThey soon decided to move together and move together. They decided to leave Kyoto where they had been living and live their lives as they are. [Music]. It's not something to be ashamed of or something to hide, but to show that the people involved are here. We're a gay couple- a former firefighter and a former police officer- and we're broadcasting on YouTube to show people that there are people involved everywhere, so that we can be an inspirationThe two of them held a mock event at an event held on the occasion of Happy Couples Day. We decided to have a wedding. The word LGBT has spread and understanding has progressed in Japan, but even so, legally it is not recognized that two people can become husband and wife. I wonder if there is any meaning in a formal wedding. As I approached the day, I received many congratulations from many people. I never imagined a life like that. Even though I received congratulations, I was worried that I would feel empty because I couldn't get married due to same-sex marriage in Japan. To be honest, I felt that way, but when I heard everyone say congratulations, honestly I cried. Until today, I couldn't have imagined doing such a happy and boring problem. [Music]- Admission- [Applause]. [Music]. We hereby vow that we will be a family that continues to walk honestly and faithfully to our feelings, without giving up on being who we are. [Applause]. At the ceremony, which was surrounded by a warm atmosphere, was the artist, Hana Hana, who has faith. The two of them also came rushing in to make a request. Meanwhile, the song Kobe requested was: Goodbye the one I love. Goodbye the one I love. The one I still love. Among the many people around him, his family is nowhere to be seen. [Music]. Mr Coffe has very little contact with his family. [ Music]. He can't bring himself to tell him that he's gay. [Music] ]. Since I came out, some of my friends have left me before I knew it. Goodbye, my beloved. I want to move forward by facing that fact. [Music]. [Applause]. Thank you for your support. Last week, I returned to Kyoto, where I used to live. The two of them were in a town where they had once given up on living openlyNow, believing that they could change society even just a little. they gave a lecture on LGBT in front of company executivesThey talked about meeting all kinds of people. If you were a LGBT person, you would be around 1 in 10 people, which is about the same as the current percentage of people who are AB blood type or left-handedHowever, there are still many people who have never met an LGBT person in their lives. But the truth is it's true, but the other side just didn't say it or couldn't say itI'd be happy if you could first of all know thatWe'd also like to use our own experiences to appeal to them about the work environment. I used to make discriminatory remarks on a daily basis, so I thought that I could never say that to this person or that they would make fun of me if they found out. but I put a lot of effort into things that weren't part of my job, and my performance at work was just mediocre. I think I may have been a bit depressed, so I would be very happy if you could focus on what I can do from now onIt's been a year since I left Kansai, and through these activities I hope that someday I can be close to my family. I hope that we can connect with each other through feelingsWhat do you think about your familyI am truly grateful to my family for raising me this far. I did n't come out because I had imagined that it would be difficult for people to accept it or that it would be difficult for them to accept it easily, but I was trying to make a statement that I was going to change society, and that's what my family did. I chose this life because I thought that there might be a way to come out that would make me think that if I was happy and smiling, it might be okay [Music].",

[Music] 2. Someone's mom is celebrating. [Music]. Two years ago, Elle became a big brother. I was so relieved. [Music]. Nobuko gave birth to a baby girl and came home. [Music]. Although there is no legal support, the four of us have been living together as a family since that dayWe want to end the year where we can do whatever we wantWe want to spend the night togetherWe want to go on trips as a familyWe are glad to have grown up like thisNo matter what kind of child you are. I guess it was a good thing, but the good thing about him is that he's always been kind to me, and I don't know what it is, but I feel really comfortable when we're togetherThere are times when people say, ``I don't like him after all''. Yes, there is, but there was a very long explanation and I could tell you everything, but recently it's not, because it's a same-sex coupleSo when people ask me what a same-sex couple is, I say well, a couple of people of the same gender. [Music] My son's. When I was in nursery school, I found out that the child who had just transferred to the school was going to be with my mother, and when I told her that she was asking me if I wanted to go inside or with the cows, she made me look like I was disgusting. [Music]. However, my son's best friend's child, who is also a classmate, first told me that his best friend's child wasn't disgusting, and then it became like the people around him were feeling the same way. and here we are. I feel so grateful that I was helped, or rather that other children really nurtured me. [Music]. Our family structure is just a part of our identity. so it's a big deal, It's not a problem, and I really feel that this can be made clear by the words and actions of the child. but that's why I think it's no good if marriage cannot be done, and it must be done legally in the sense of protecting the child. It is absolutely necessary to protect it. so I guess that will lead to that.",

        "transcript": "Nanako Imazu lives in Tokyo. I live with my female partnerSince we are together, we feel like we know each other quite well, such as what we are not good at, so we leave the cooking to each other. I have already introduced my partner to his family and he tells me that he will be bringing his partner to a party at the foreign company he works forIt's Friday, and I get an invitation saying that I can bring my partner on Saturdays and Sundays, so I've been talking to my partner there recently. It seems like they're using the word partner instead of husband or wife. I do n't like seeing the discriminatory remarks about LGBT sexual minorities coming from Prime Minister Kishida's aides. I do n't like it, even if I think they live next door, I think some people will abandon Japan if same-sex marriage is allowedThe trigger for the discriminatory remarks was Prime Minister Kishida's comments regarding the legalization of same-sex marriageIt will change families, values and society for all citizens. This is an issue that is becoming more and more commonIf same-sex marriage is allowed, families values and society will not change, but it will changeHowever. it is not that the number of LGBT people will increase because of the same-sex marriage, but it is because they are already here and are normalized in society. I would like everyone to understand once again that they are contributing and living as members of societyMy partner, Megu Fujimoto, says that it is not about things that change or remain the same, but that it is about people. I don't think that this is the result of people who have lived their lives as hard as they can, so this is not the way things should beIn today's Diet. the first person I asked about the discriminatory comments was a member of the Liberal Democratic Party who is a relative of mineFirst I looked at Prime Minister Kishida's book. I would like to ask you about the government's stance toward sexual minorities, including the thoughts you put into your bookPrime Minister Kishida's Vision includes the following statement: There must be a place and a role for everyone in society, whether they are women, office workers, working mothers, housewives, people with disabilities or LGBT peopleIn the Diet, Prime Minister Kishida said that he too, was once a minority, and I myself was an elementary school student in New York. I believe that the thoughts of those who have had the unfortunate experience of not being able to fully demonstrate their roles and abilities because of their experiences as a minority or because they are LGBT are the foundation of this, Hajime Arai. The series of statements made by the Prime Minister's Secretary-General have caused misunderstanding among the publicThis is truly regrettable and I would like to apologize to those who have felt uncomfortableThe Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan is the originator of the discriminatory remarks. This expression, which takes issue with Prime Minister Kishida's remark and changes society, is also perceived as a very negative expression by those involvedI would like to request an apology and retraction on this point as well. Regarding the introduction of the system, society must recognize that it is an issue that relates to the basics of people's lives and is closely related to each citizen's family, and in that sense, it is an issue that broadly affects all citizens. I am saying that things will changeI am by no means saying anything negative and I am not denying this discussionThe Prime Minister, who has neither apologized nor retracted his remarks. Prime Minister Kishida's statement that society would change was not in the response prepared by the Ministry of Justice, but was a so- called ad-lib by Prime Minister KishidaI asked Prime Minister Kishida what he really meant when he said that he used the expression \"society will change\". Please answer again, Mr Prime Minister. I said that introducing such a system will change society because it is an issue that broadly affects all citizens. He explained that a discussion is necessary and that he is not negative about the same-sex marriage debateHow did Mr Imazu and his partner Megu Fujimoto respond to the Diet's response? Mr Kishida himself said he wanted to discuss it. I think that everything is being considered, such as looking into it in a positive manner, but Japan is the only country in the G7 that does not recognize same-sex marriageTheir thoughts are that of Japan. I think the ideal would be a society in which everyone living in a country can live their lives in their own way, but I don't think there are that many people who would be at a disadvantage if we allowed same-sex marriage to begin tomorrow. I don't think soI think this bill is just to make gay people who want to get married happy, so I wish they would think about it with a little more restraintWhat do you think of these opinions? I would like to hear the Prime Minister's opinion, but it is noticeable that Japan is lagging behind in its efforts to create a society that recognizes diversityAs mentioned in the video, Japan is one of the G7 countries. Japan is the only country in the world that does not legally recognize same-sex marriage, and Japan is the only country that does not have a law prohibiting discrimination against sexual minorities. Mr Nakamura, how do you view this situation? Yes, the world. While 30 countries are establishing partnerships and similar rights, Japan is the only member of the G7 that has not, and this is an issue that has been pointed out to the United Nations for over 20 years. There are so many reports and papers that say that countries that protect rights related to marriage and LGBTQ have higher GDP and economic effects than other countries, and some people will abandon Japan. I think he said something like that, but I really wonder why he came up with such a statement. considering that both the Prime Minister and his secretaries have a background of overseas experience. I get the feeling that some people would rather leave countries that don't move toward recognizing diversity. but you're right. Mr Nakamura made a statement earlier. Secretary, In response to this, Prime Minister Kishida supported preparations for the submission of a bill to promote understanding of LGBT peopleThis bill promotes understanding of sexual minoritiesTwo years ago, a bipartisan coalition of parliamentarians agreed to pass the bill. However, due to opposition within the Liberal Democratic Party, its submission to the Diet was postponedThe bottleneck was the statement included in the bill that discrimination was unacceptableAt the time the Liberal Democratic Party, which was mainly cautious. Senator Nishida said this yesterday. Strengthening legal measures to prohibit discrimination may seem like a good thing at first glance, but the opposite problem arisesThose who promote it are likely to introduce prohibitive provisions and penalties. This is not a good idea because it divides society. In other words, writing that discrimination is not tolerated leads to new prohibitions and penalties, which leads to social divisionA former Liberal Democratic Party minister also said this Honestly. I feel the same way and the people around me are against the bill, but they say it's hard for them to raise their voices. Mr Nakamura, how do you respond to these opinions? Well, just because we're a same-sex couple, For example, it may be difficult to find a place to live, or you may not be able to receive tax deductions for dependents like a married couple, or you may not be able to inheritYour rights are no longer guaranteedThey are being infringed upon, and you may not like or dislike the Prime Minister or the government's exchangesSociety. I do n't think it's a good idea to talk about it in a casual way. like the values \u200b\u200bof peopleI think politics works because it guarantees those rights and people who fall in love with the opposite sex What is considered to be the majority does not necessarily mean that everyone will fall in love with someone of the opposite sex, but it should be up to each person to choose the person they like, get married, have children, etc. There is such a gradation. I think that LGBTQ is one of them. so I think the role of the government is to take all of that into consideration and create a society where people are protected, even if there are people who don't like them. It is true that the debate has become lively due to a series of statements on this issue, and I am looking forward to seeing if this will help get the bill passed.",

If Japanese people do not understand or do not want such a society, that is a choice, and it is a democratic procedure to make it the rule of Japanese society.

Same-sex marriage is not recognized in Japan. A Japanese man married a man of the same sex in France, where same-sex marriage is recognized. Okay, got married. got married While transmitting ballet exercises. Currently she is spending her married life with her beloved dog (My dog \u200b\u200bVision). I guess it's been a long time since I've been able to get married. I have given up on not being able to live a normal life. [Music]: A partner who changed the life I had given up on [Music], The feeling of ``giving up'' rather than ``pain''. I couldn't say it All the time. I didn't know what to say anymore, so I was worried that it would look weird if I did. I wonder if I'll be taken out. I was afraid of being bullied, so I couldn't show my true self. In the end I was scared, so I guess I was bullied, or rather I was left out. I knew I had to go to school, but I also had club activities. There was a men's tennis club, but I never went to it, So I didn't have the heart to actively go into those areas. It's hard to tell and I haven't told my parents either. I wish you noticed, though I agree. So there were a lot of things that I had given up on. [Music]. French culture is different from Japan. Well, in a sense, people in Japan see it as a category and in France they see it as normal, so they don't have to go out of their way to say ``I'm gay''. You do n't even have to say \"I'm gay\". I just knew that there was a world like this. It feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. [Music]: Announcement of marriage and homosexuality. While we were talking together, I wondered what to do, so I clicked on the Instagram post and announced it. It was really scary to think that there would be people who didn't like it. For the first time, I felt that there were people who supported me and accepted me so much because of what I said. Some people say ``My son is gay'' or ``I'm gay'', but the announcement gave them hope. I was really happy that there were people like that and that I was able to give them hopeThe good thing about being with Chris is that I can say it to the world. This was huge. It comes naturally to me when I'm outside. I think it's really easy for me to do things when the students are talking, because I can do it so naturally. [Music]. My feelings changed after encountering Chris and French culture. For a long time, I had given up on the idea that I would never get married. I had given up on not being able to live a normal life. I thought it would be like that. but when I met Chris, he was really kind When I thought it would be great. when I lived in France, we ended up getting married. I thought it would be great if we could get married. I didn't tell him until right before we got married. I told my sister and mother and I was thinking a lot about when I was going to tell my father, but in the end I still completely turn my back on him. It's like you don't understand. (On the other hand) I received a letter from my mother. What really surprised me was that from now on, please respect and cherish each other. That's what was written. That really moved me. My mother has been feeling it for a long time now. I wonder if they've already accepted it as normal. I really felt that they had accepted me. (How I felt when I got married). The two of us were doing this and there were viewers At that time. Mr Mayor said that in France, no matter what culture you have, no matter what nationality or race you are, no matter what kind of people you are, we will accept you as long as we have love for you. When I said that, it hit me hard. I was like ``Oh, I'm getting married''. I was so happy. when I heard that, I was so happy. I was so happy, Yeah. [Music]. I was impressed. In France, instead of ``same-sex marriage'', there is only ``marriage''. That's different now: \"Marriage\", not \"same-sex marriage\". Yes, it's called \"marriage\". [Music] (Marriage). There is no category. One of my dreams is to have a child. I want a child. I want 4 people. I want 4 people. [Laughter]. There is a way to do it. adoption: From what I heard, it seems that homosexual adoption in France is difficult. Apparently, it takes about 10 years (in France due to procedures etc). [Music]: What we both want to convey. When I was little, I really wanted my mom and dad to notice me, but those are just my thoughts. However, the words your father is saying now are his thoughts. Of course, the laws in Japan (France) and Japan are different, but I think I was able to meet Chris and realize what I wanted to do and what I wanted to do. I believe that thinking, thinking and such things absolutely lead to results. I think it's very important to accept yourself. \u201cEveryone has a right to love\u201d [Music].",

TJ [Music] It's now FenlessApen also uses itWe've been living together for 13 yearsUp until now, the two of us have been helping with the fires, but now it's mainly the town's help. As I said, I remember Teresa has a baby in her belly. She got pregnant through sperm donation from two mutual friends. How many months pregnant are she now? She's 8 months pregnant. Just over 3 months left. Hey, Hey, we can finally meet each other. I want to meet you. There's always a girl: b 00, ca, Aaaaa- A long- awaited life for a female couple. However, there's something that bothers them. Well, I don't have parental rights. Wait, I thought I'd drink some leather. but the point is, unless the person who doesn't give birth has parental rights, they can't legally be considered parents. Ms Sakata says that when she was in high school, she realized that her love interest was a woman that is, a lesbian. I met Teresa when we were both in our 20s and fell in love with each other and we got married seven years agoHowever, this was in the United States, where Teresa's son is the only person who can marry someone of the same sex. Since it became possible to do so in 2014,, I thought, `` Okay, let's do it''. I wanted to bring something to prove the relationship between the two public figuresYes, the two became a family in the United States and they also lived in Japan three years ago. [Music]. Same-sex marriages are not allowed in this country. [Music]. Teresa will have custody of the unborn child. I am legally a single mother, even though I am raising a child with only two peopleI want things to be made simple and quicklyI want them to be able to do it in a really successful wayIf I continue to do what I am doing now, I will really be doing a disservice to my children. so what kind of preparations should I make? Even if you do, in the end, that point is just a piece of paper. Not allowing marriage between low school students is discrimination that violates the freedom of marriage guaranteed by the Constitution 2019 Same-sex couples. They filed suit against the government in five courts across the country. Sakata and Teresa also participated in the lawsuit at the Osaka District Court and the trial has been going on for three years. I want to live in a society where the mist before the lights is a given and where it is necessary to be guaranteedI want to live in a society where it is natural for people to say things like: \"I want people to recognize their loved ones as family\". It's a wish, but it's a serious one for the parties involved. Hello, here we are, Mr Kiyoshi Kawabata and others. Mr Yuki Kawabata, A male couple participating in the trial b 6 cases. They lived together because they renovated an old private house in Kagawa Prefecture. It was just for the time being. A measurement app would be great. We've been together for 15 years this year. I love cooking. I'm good at it, I know it's in the fridge, It's better than Mr Carter's and I want it. In terms of the previous meaning, I also make it sometimes. It's all good. now that I'm completely satisfied with thisI'm writing a recordMy friends and family understand what we're going through, but it wasn't all smooth sailing from the beginningI first started when I was about 23.. I left a third person behindI didn't see him for a long time after I graduated from high school and when I finally started dating him, I told my parents for the first time at 32.What was their reaction? There was a lot of disagreement and Tanaka was about to be disowned. but when Tanaka confessed that she liked Kawada, who was a man, her father strongly objected and her mother intervened and they had a series of family meetingsIn the end, My relatives also supported me and they started to support me in a lot of ways. so I started to think that my father's support was around this and that That's what I think. but after that their father also accepted them and says he supports them nowOn the other hand, Mr Kawada and his father thought that there were quite a few families like this and their relationship was constant. I was surprised at first when I heard this, but I quickly accepted it because I had friends who were sexual minorities. but in order for homosexuals to become a normal part of the world, the country needs to change. Yeah, I think there are a lot of people who care a lot about it, like if the mayor's election is ok or if the country is ok, then that generation will be too. Partnership systems in which local governments certify that they are family members are becoming more widespread, and Mr Tanaka and Mr Kawada took the initiative three years ago in their home city of MitoyoHowever, the rights of spouses, such as inheritance and preferential tax treatment that are gained through marriage, are now recognized. After all, I thought that the social recognition that the people around me recognized it was that important, and when it became clear that the government was going to start making money, I realized that people who had previously faced such negative experiences. I wonder if everyone will be able to live a normal lifeIf same-sex people could get married. we would become normal people and we would be able to live in a more comfortable society. [Music]. I am transgender myself. Shun Nakaoka, a lawyer who handles many family and gender- related lawsuits, says that Japanese law was created on the premise that marriage is between a man and a womanIn fact, the Civil Code and Family Registration Law state that marriage is. There is no provision at all that says marriage can only occur with the opposite sexHowever, as is the case with the use of the phrase \"husband and wife\", the same is true when it comes to the point where marriage is between people of the same sexThe Civil Code does not assume marriage between people of the same sex. [Music]. In other words, it's not that marriage between people of the same sex is prohibited by law. it's just that it's not intended to exist in the first place. [Music]. That's why the Agricultural Policy Couples brought about this. It is said that the lawsuit has an important meaning of protecting the human rights of sexual minoritiesIt is completely impossible that the approval of copper concentrate would destroy the society or force people to succeed. In any case, it's just a matter of recognizing the rights of such a personIn any case, it means recognizing the person's actionsSocial equality, uh, respect for human rightsWhat should the courts do? Will we make a judgment? The Osaka District Court's judgment of the first instance is only a passing judgment. [Music]. Well, I think it would be nice if we could have a legal system that would allow people to live without any worries. However, I believe that discrimination and prejudice still remain deep-rooted, so I would like to see a society where people can have hope that, even if they are born gay, there will be no change and that they will be able to hook up and get married right away. [Music].",

        "transcript": "He knew me for 15 years. He knew what I was like. It was not at all expected that I would go there now. \u00abWell, no, Well, I don\u2019t think that works at all Being gayno\". My name is Marcus Pfaar and I'm originally from Bremen. I then moved to Bern at the beginning of 2019.. - Yes, so I'm Christine. I come from Delmenhorst. This is a small town next to Bremen. -. Our first meeting was at my best friend's wedding. It was a bachelorette wedding, not a super classy celebration, but really a party. And then it happened that I had just decided to build up courage and then talk to him. It was getting to the end and he spoke to me while I was drinking, And then it happened relatively quickly. It was also very funny. Like I said, I had to go home. We just managed to get him to give me his phone number. Of course, that was really annoying for me, because now I had the phone number and now, of course, I had to act. Then I called him at night. I thought, \u201cI'll call straight away and leave an answering machine when I get home. Then I'm out of the game, Then he has to report back\u201d. What I hadn't considered is that my home is much further away than his. And then he answered \u2013 that night. Do you remember when I answered the phone and said, \"Oh, I didn't really want you, I wanted the answering machine\"? And he said: -: \u00abI can hang up again and then you can call again and speak to the answering machine \u00bb? * laugh *. - The actual meeting was also very funny. That was, um, We ended up in your apartment - Exactly Correct. - And then I thought, \"It's been hours now and nothing had happened\". And then I looked at him: \u201cDon\u2019t you want to or can\u2019t you\u201d. And then he couldsomehow, And obviously wanted to too. Yes, that's how it was. - Well, homosexuality in my family wasn't even an issue for a long time. If I went to my parents now and said, \"Dad, um, I'm gay too\", Then that would absolutely be the case for me, So that absolutely wouldn't have worked at all. I imagined the worst \u2013 ultimately. That's why I didn't say \"Dad, I'm gay, Your son is gay too\u201d, but then decided for myself: \u201cThen you probably have to go the other way now. Then you have to look for the \u2018supposedly\u2019 right path\u201d. And then I tried to work my way into the heterosexual track. - You picked me up from work. He picked me up from work and then we drove home And then I told him he would like to pull over to the right. Um, Then I explained to him that I'm pregnant now and we have to get married now too. Yes, romance is different - Definitely, That's always you, anyway. \u201cIf you want romance, light a candle\u201d. *laughs*. It was one of the greatest moments for me in the end, because I found out that I was going to be a father And I was just super happy. yes, I met my current partner through Instagram. Somehow, I only had 10 followers And he wasn't even one of them. I went jogging in the morning and took a photo of it, - sweaty, As I'm walking there. I posted it and he liked the photo. And then he liked it Because you had so few likes and stuff like that. you could also write to people personally. I then thanked him for it and that's how we started talking to each other. Exactly then I found out that he was gay And I saw the photo of him and I actually fell in love with him straight away - just visually, just because of the photo - For me, this Swiss guy only showed up shortly before you invited him. Yes, that was a relatively sure signal that something was strange. How was that? You had only gotten to know him as a follower on Instagram - you didn't know him before - and he wanted to come to Bremen and want to see Bremen - Yes - And you made yourself available quite selflessly: \u201cMan, I\u2019d like to show him Bremen, and then I\u2019ll invite him home and you\u2019ll bake pizza\u201d. So I basically baked pizza for my successor - It just happened once that I actually cheated, and that was exactly on the weekend when I showed him Bremen. I actually showed him Bremen - Very clear and thorough *laughs*. The hotels *laughs* - But I had to have experienced it somewhere to know: \u201cIs that really what I want\u201d. It was incredibly difficult for me that he left again, even though it was clear that he had to leave again. first. Um, Yeah, I just took him to the airport and I really cried. And then Christine came in and then it didn't take long, and then she asked the question again: \"So I want to know now: what's the matter now? Will we be able to save our marriage or will it no longer serve any purpose\" Then I lay there on the sofa and at first I didn't know what to do or how to react. But somehow it became clear that it had to come out now. And then I said: \"Um, Christine, I don't think anything will come of it because I realize that I like men and I fell in love, and it's the Swiss guy\". - Of course, I was first completely run over once, Because, even if you had already thought about it a little bit, when it is actually said it is suddenly a completely different house number. But, as I said, I didn't want him as a partner anymore. For me it just took a turn likeum Jackpot, Because I got rid of my husband. I kept my father and boyfriend. He officially wanted to continue to look after his children, but I didn't want him as a partner anymore. The drop was sucked And, by the way, he was a little bit offended. He thought I had to be a little bit sad or had to cry a little bit. Then, every now and then he would ask: \"Yes, but tell me honestly\": \"No, that's okay with me, it's really okay with me\". He knew me for 15 years. He knew what I was like. It wasn't at all expected that I would go and say: \"Well, no, being gay, so no\". After that I also got together with a woman. That was, of course, very strange for everyone involved, especially for Marcus, who of course initially had this impulse: \"Now I've done it this way, now you have to do it this way too\". But that wasn't quite the case - No, that wasn't. - Yes, yes, That is what you have said, And it actually came from you originally. \u201cWell, I had already imagined that you would get to know a man after me\u201d, You said, And then I said: \u201cOh, that\u2019s what the gay guy says. all right, That's how we do it. You can, but I can't\". This is also a colleague of mine And she had often asked very directly. She is a very extroverted person and made it very clear that she was already interested. Shortly afterwards we had a company party where the celebration was very intense. Then this colleague directly hit on me again And then I told her what I had just said. When he said: \"No, I'm straight\". I told her that just to slow her down, because everyone really noticed And it was also a company. I didn't want to make it clear right away that something was going on. and then I just said to her: \"Well, just because my husband has now become gay, you can't assume that I'm also homosexual. now Leave me alone, I'm straight\". Then of course she was hurt. at first she thought it was just so moderately funny, but we were all far too drunk to really take it seriously. I then pushed her away from me, But she has proven to be very stubborn, and then at some point you just give in And I liked her too \u2013 well, I really liked her. I liked them before too. and um - What? - Yes, And then suddenly there was this jealous scene, which was very funny because we were apart as partners, But But I think that feeling of ownership was still there for a little bit. - No -. Well then please explain the freak out at the \u201chigh altitude\u201d. Well, this is a forest near us, Because we lived in the same house and bedroom. I outsourced getting to know my girlfriend, And then I just didn't come home And Marcus somehow had the feeling that \u201cmother\u201d had to come home now. Then he rushed into the parking lot. It was really like in the movie: We were sitting in this car, we were both sitting in her car, and then his car came next to it - roared next to it If there had been asphalt, squealing tires - The door flew open And then her friend and I yelled at each other. I don't know exactly what it was about either. I think she somehow asked: \"What's this number about now and what are you doing here\", And then I somehow answered something that I no longer know. Then she came around the car and shouted at me: \u201cWhat kind of performance is this? You can go home right now. That does not work like this\". And Then I actually - and that annoyed me even more - I got into the car without having done anything. I drove there in a hurry and drove home again in a hurry. Nothing changed it. *laughs*. I'm just really happy with my life overall. Um, I thought it was definitely the right decision. Sure, you always have people who look at you stupidly on the street. I consciously always walk down the street hand in hand with Thomas. I'm also proud that I can do this. I don't miss that either, and if someone's eyes are wide open and I notice that they start whispering to their neighbor and then look, then sometimes it goes like this: * shows middle finger * And then they move on.",

        "transcript": "We have been together for 14 years and married for seven years. We now have two children, We have become a family, and that is Summer, who is now four years old, and Jaden, who just turned two. This is what we always wanted, And we really enjoy it together with the children, and now we can see how it works. Of course, that's nice too, And we can simply have fun, and the children will also be absorbed in it. And now things are messing around again here. I think a little bit that it brings out the best in you, because you now have such a nice time together, a feeling of togetherness which I think is exactly the definition of family. And while still on my honeymoon, Tobias asked me the question Can you imagine having children? To which I didn't even respond at first because I'm a few years older and it was a crazy idea. I said it quite freely, just as we openly talk about it on many topics, and just watched how he reacted. The reaction was muted. I grew up in the 1990s. For example. I still knew about paragraph 175, even though it was no longer in practice, but that was still there. Coming out was also difficult in the country. But marriage for everyone, getting married, having a partner and now children too. That just was n't on the table for me. It's hard to believe today that she is so big. I grew up very sheltered, but of course society and everything around it does something to you. You can already tell that people who come out that it doesn't work well, that they are chased out of the farm, that they are attacked. And then I had a bit of an advantage in that people don't see it that way with me, And I was particularly good at camouflage and hiding, And then I did that too. It was just easier for me to get through it like that. And then you put that aside, you're just pragmatic and you try to push away the things that you know won't work because they're not acceptable, because you think you can live better with that. Then there are the fighters who fight against it, the revolutionaries, And I was more of a person who tried not to stand out and pretend that I wasn't, And then you push it away and then it doesn't happen anymore. But also partnerships, marriage and families in general also live in Germany - with children anyway, And then it's just not there. It was a strange feeling for me because of course I expected that. yes, he agreed so directly. On the other hand, I understood that the question was How, And I think he also gave up on the idea of \u200b\u200bhaving a family as a gay man, ie having children of his own- very early on. I understood more and more during the conversations why the initial reaction was very hesitant. All in all, it became clear that my husband's desire to have children was already more deeply rooted than he perhaps initially thought. You live in such a cocoon and then, of course, you realize that everything else has developed, that marriage was obviously possible. That's why we were on our honeymoon and had just become partners. Marriage for all came a year later. You just realize that what you have impregnated yourself with is no longer reality and that society has become more modern, more liberal, more tolerant and that many things have become easier. And then you start to open up and come out of the cocoon, And that happened relatively quickly for me. thanks to his help, I could actually imagine it very quickly How. That was the big question that bothered me for a long time. I was familiar with adoption and taking in foster children, but I increasingly had the feeling that I just wanted to have a biological child of my own, And then by chance we saw a report on the subject of surrogacy and then the seed was planted. Then we said- or I said to myself at first- That could be a way, even if it was still very vague and you did n't know at all. how does it actually work? I've never heard of that before either. This is our surrogate mother, Erica. We went to Universal Studios with Erica, Joe and their kids to spend the day. Summer was still in the hospital at the time. Summer was the last one there. She was there shortly before she was released. This is the Erica with the Joe. She held Summer in her arms again for a moment. I think it was just before we left. When deciding to go this route, it was immediately clear that neither of them wanted to deny the other the desire to have a biological child. I think that was the first thing that confirmed to us. We will have two children, one in which my husband is the genetically biological father and one in which I am the father. At the beginning, when she was very small, around the first year, you could see my husband very clearly. Now it's getting a bit lost, but I suspect that he sees Jaden as me too, But overall, for us it doesn't matter who is there. now I love Summer just as much as Jaden. They are our children. Now that they are a little older, their mother also reflects a little bit in what they are like or what they naturally look like. This is also exciting to watch. We made the decision back then to use an egg donor, And they are also chosen based on likeability, based on appearance, just like any other person gets to know someone with whom they might then want to have children, And that's exciting to see now. maybe the temperament, even if you never know how much comes across, but that you already have the feeling. Yes, this person is part of it, and we see them now too in our children. We deal with the entire topic very openly and very pragmatically. We're not so thin-skinned now. either. We can also take criticism well and deal with it pragmatically. But it's already there. you won't be invited to the children's birthday party, or you might not be there at the Halloween parade. And then at first it doesn't matter and you say to yourself: Well, okay, then not, Was there a reason? And in the second moment you think to yourself: Isn't it because we're different? We have the appropriate resilience. We also have a story that we came out that we were offended at school or at university or wherever in life. With children it is a different issue and we are more attentive. We try to classify it, to explain that maybe people actually have a problem with us, Which doesn't have to mean that they have a problem with you, the child, Summer or Jaden, And we try to give them the appropriate resilience and resilience and to classify and explain this again and again - and they are already being confronted with it: How, For example, that other children in kindergarten say: You don't have a mom. But I'm most worried about this hidden hostility. I have to say I have a lot of friends who are very conservative, but I can still sit and talk to them in the evening because they have a clear stance and say: I reject that for these and these reasons. And they have different values \u200b\u200band different ideas about life. But you can discuss that. you can start there. What's more difficult are all the families out there who then say, No, we don't have a problem with them, that's wonderful, everything's nice, they have children, It's nice that they're living their dream, but then when they get home they say No, you're not going there with me And then tell your child that, and then at some point the children get older and go into other families or they want to invite someone over, and then there may be barriers and hurdles that we pass on to our children, so to speak, whether they want it or not. That's something you have to deal with it and try to explain it to them. We are both \u201cdads\u201d. actually, There are no distinctions except in the volume when we call someone. We really did this. We are parents now And we live as a family like any family, and simply enjoy the time with our children as they develop, What they do, what new things they learn. This is beautiful to me.",

Yes, the mood couldn't be better at Schalke Dortmund. Mother, mother can carry on. how are they about the fact that women want to be ordained? now here, I think they can, or something like that. okay, I can put it another way. no, I put it differently. so the fact that women now also want to be ordained is really nonsense, or something like that. now we also have the demand, On the other hand, the blessing of homosexuals. in Germany, even trains are blessed. of course, everything can be blessed by the Catholic Church, except homosexuals who love each other. that's again a natural union, a thing that doesn't belong blessed. there are blessings seen here, like two ICE trains being coupled into mine. Name for it. or, yes, I, I \u20ac5 from me. If you kill someone, it's a bit different than if you love someone of the same gender. [music]. I'm now going to take a look at the major reforms of the Catholic Church, so I'll do it together with mine. Cameraman, Jesus, we haven't actually closed anything. why? what happened? We just decided that, instead of changing something. we'll check whether we want to change anything at all. I would say the old men's association remains: no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, No. it's really cool that you're a bishop. It's really cool if you 're a bishop, and the only hope I have left is actually: the Holy Spirit is supposedly a pigeon, and I have the experience that pigeons also poop on someone's head every now and then. I would also know which real welcome victim could be a victim. I'm also happy. they're basically a legend, a living legend, exactly great. and in your show too, they're actually against the ordination of women, because women simply can't cover it up as well as they can. Men are just getting there and I'm not really healthy at all. I'll just come in and level 3 is on and you've got sauerkraut in there. Gerd has known for a long time and if the valve isn't opened a little, then the sauerkraut will go to the ceiling. my picture, a beautiful parable. it's a pity that they won't even be ordained at some point and can tell something like that in church. I'm standing here with Auxiliary Bishop Ansgar Puff. Mr Puff, when will this Puff finally be so reformed that I can blow away all the problems with a Puff where you can say that there's finally peace in the Poof. I like my name too. yes, they want to toast now. the Pope has already said no. the Pope hasn't said no, he's letting us go.

        "transcript": "Imagine if the Vatican published a letter tomorrow saying that breathing is now permitted, with the restriction that it should not be done in worship spaces or in the liturgy, so that breathing would not be confused with singing. the world would then be as enthusiastic as they are. it's now after the past. write feduia suikans, the pleading trust. what's going on in the Vatican? breathing is allowed, but please do n't sing. you think it's a stupid comparison? I'm honestly not so sure about it. this letter reminds me of old ones Debates, very, very old debates in the church, in which it was always about not adapting too much to the world and especially not letting the spirit of the times into the interior of the church, and when you then realized that people did n't let their actions be forbidden, Throwing a bridge to the pack. now it's not about breathing and/or singing, but it's about blessing. In these pastoral meanings of blessings, it's about what to do with the people who live in the most so-called irregular situations, who, to put it concretely, are, for example, lesbian or gay. These people should now be given the opportunity to receive church blessing. The big problem is that this church blessing includes a willingness to allow themselves to be changed in accordance with the gospel to embark on this path of life that is faithful to the gospel and to be open to the change that the gospel and God bring about. I'm very sorry. I don't understand this enthusiasm for this paper. I've read in some newspapers that this paper is a door opener for an irreversible development, after which the next step should be to enable honors for everyone, including for homosexual couples, rather than the pastoral one. Reality shows us that the people who ask for the blessing actually want marriage. The paper that the Vatican presented to us is, for me, not just an anti-modernist deception. no, it is much more a slap in the face to those who have to repeatedly be described as irregular, To have to be insulted, to have to be discriminated against. For me, this paper is a bottomless impudence that is brimming with cowardice, because what is happening here is not to open or lead a dogmatically substantive debate, but to give a canonical liturgical instruction according to which the blessing of homosexuals Couples simply can no longer be suspected. it is no longer forbidden, but allowed, tolerated, because it should not be promoted. that is what it says in the paper. it should not be promoted the blessing of homosexual couples, because it supports something that does not correspond to the norm. the background is irregular. What's in favor is that people shouldn't run the risk of confusing these celebrations with a marriage. that's an impudence. Discrimination is that. I'm angry, but really not disappointed. I didn't expect more, because those who decide and have to decide are moved by fear. They are afraid of the church split. they are afraid of losing the sovereignty of interpretation within society and the world, a sovereignty of interpretation that, in my opinion, has been lost for a long time. Free people who love themselves know about God as he is. I was in priestly training in Germany for 8 years. I got to know seminaries across Europe and also in the USA. I experienced seminarians. I experienced priests, deacons, bishops, regents and trainers. I dare to say that one-third to two-thirds of the church's clergy are homosexual. these men are trained in a system in which they have to be repeatedly labeled as irregular. they have the feeling of not being right, of not being wanted, of not conforming to the norm. what's the point of that other than to fear and self-hatred towards themselves? I am firmly convinced that these men can only create freedom and peace if they are allowed to experience this peace and freedom themselves With this message from the Vatican. for me, this peace and freedom cannot be achieved. We have to get down to the nitty-gritty of what is going on dogmatically in the Vatican and in the Church. On the one hand, there are people who say that this paper is a necessary step in the right direction to reduce discrimination and welcome people in their diversity into our Church. For the others, this letter doesn't go far enough. They would have liked more in terms of the dogmatic content. They would have liked it to be about real, substantive changes in attitude. This paper is sorely lacking. Where do you position yourself? on one side or on the other or in between? please let us know and write us your point of view in the [music] comments. [music].",

What bothers me most in this paper is the term &quot;irregular relationships&quot;, because a relationship is either good or not good, but certainly not irregular, there is simply no such thing! The people who rail against homosexuality are almost always those who are affected by it themselves and therefore have the biggest problem with it. Moreover, homosexuality is often reduced to sexual practices, but people forget that it is about much more, namely love, affection, life together... And that is supposed to be a sin? The church could close down without the gay priests, I know that because I was in the seminary and found out afterwards that 1/3 were gay!

I have absolutely no idea about food, maybe, or nutrition, somehow, that gay community, but the direction and I have no imagination at the moment. but These two signs really are that he stands for women's rights. it's good to imagine, but that's purely a fantasy. although she stands up briefly and stands for l, 4 sb, like for sexuality support, b, so up to 6t for the stand. the q stands for everything else, for everything else, so not just for the women. yes, yes, that's why so colorful. yes, of course, Esther, two days, or the doctor watch what happens. I don't know what did. kohl was something. doctor. Poland is difficult, but in any case, support. ultimately the team has to find out for themselves in what kind and campos. It 's probably a current question, a difficult question. Yes, you have to live with it and tell what you are: the child. It's just the way it is. Personally, I do n't have any children either, but I would definitely accept it because it would be natural for me to have one together Daughter, after a future of six. until then, there is no discrimination if you feel like you are in the wrong body and you want to change that, then I would take a supportive position. well, today he often overreacts quickly and of course he should first consider the biological condition of the child clearly, examine and, if it is actually the case that the child has really ended up in the wrong body, then take the necessary measures. he actually needs someone. only the woman's circle of friends has become a man, and I know that there is a lot of suffering and can represent. maybe hear me deal with it, wouldn't? I would like to inform myself more because I do n't know that much about it myself. When it comes to having children, I think everyone would have to accept it and really accept it. I wouldn't necessarily be happy about it because I think that such children still have a hard time in society. I definitely have to, yes, nature, and nature can't be thought of. Yes, with my current opinion, I would accept that when we were children, there was a grasp of it or the concept of the tried and tested. Well, that's how we grew up with it. but how personal can it be? This difference is actually a difference of opinion. it's also such a great story, so it wouldn't be a problem, You would want to take it up and try to solve the problem as best as you can. yes, in that case there's no way our child can avoid it. as is the case, child feels most comfortable, so the therapy eg start with hormone adidas, what the child imagines and wishes. we know how divided I am. in principle. there is nothing to say about it in itself like cleaning children in the sense that clinics suffer from it. then afterwards In your environment, that's not all people demand again. that's the problem. otherwise they might be in better hands than in others. Why is it great? I also think adoption is really great because it usually gives the children the chance to have a better life To lead, and maybe just for the Wiggert family. I'm totally in favor of it. It's a thousand times better for a child to live with two parents of the same sex at work than in a house where parental authority dominates the agenda, and I don't think that's even the case. Rarely now, then, so gladly. I don't have a problem with order, so it's not good what I've been about so far. it's actually quite nice, but they do their job well. I do n't think they know the reasons for their track well, not only did it take me a while to get used to the idea, but I am- I'm a bit conservative at my age, Somewhere I'm so influenced by the fact that maybe one set of parents consists of the other woman just to give the child certain role models in behavior, whatever. I just don't have the perspective I have now. Circle of acquaintances are certainly gay couples. yes, but they haven't adopted children. 99, 9, it depends on the person themselves. say to me: imagine the same as with heterosexual parents. yes, it's so nice if they take care, if they want to do that. I think it's always the opinion afterwards from the respective child. I come together with other children. Questions are then: yes, you have two dads as an example, but you have to miss them more and see what and people they are. not all of them are suitable for it. yes, if you say yes, you would like to have a child, great Good for me. there are also far too few families who take children in and that would be another pool that you can expand. we would definitely be a big advantage. if you want children and want to start a family, then that is the only option for you, because you can't get it that way, or, and if that's still always problematic, with risks, or lesbian couples can be just as good parents. maybe that's a bit unusual for the kit that there are still, for example, two fathers or mothers, and maybe you think so. Why do the others have a mother and a father? but I think it's still possible and that the child is affected by it. No, it's total nonsense. I don't know why you're so old-fashioned about it. No, absolutely not. I think the Catholic Church has done a lot of things wrong lately. anyway, You are in Limburg, especially with the bishop, so I think you should first clarify a problem and, above all, the questions, and only then deal with such topics, especially at this time, which I think makes sense if you also think differently- And I don't think the Catholics are mobile in Germany, but I think that's an act. yes, and why? I don't give it a try? because my language is perfect? not at all. The university roundabout painter introduced this in all administrative texts. you should practically have a gender- neutral space here, so, as in our example, you would say to the students: simply to include everyone. what do you think about it? We grew up with them as students. that is The idea behind it takes some getting used to. yes, it would be difficult to accept. I understand the intention and think it's great, but it actually annoys me sometimes when they pay attention to it. It does n't annoy me if you just say it like that, but if someone doesn't respond to the fact that I'm a student and As students have said, sometimes it's too much of a good thing, but it's absolutely great, I think it's good, just like a normal life. you have that today too, but I think it's okay. It's not a neuter term for students in the sense in which I say it applies All closed and can you do it like that? Where's the problem? If that's the way it's supposed to be, I don't think there's a problem with it. But I don't have a problem with it. I'm not worth mentioning. I'm actually not that big of a fan of it because I think that these little things where you spend time are other things that are also in that direction but are perhaps more important. But that's just a matter of taste. I think it's interesting to divide it up for myself and make an effort if it's women's and it's not that narrow. yes, there's now also a version with this in capital letters in between. so, yes, I have n't missed it yet, but just This is also evident in such small things in everyday life that this will happen to us too, so I don't really have an opinion. I think you can do it. It doesn't bother me whether it's simply written as a student or with this spelling. yes, it is will be surpassed, but it takes getting used to and somewhere success soon. language what you learned in school at some point- and I'm only a little older than the three of you here. I won't want to get used to the new and I wo n't get used to it, and I think something like that is stupid. I don't think that speaking is a threat to me personally, So it never bothered me if, for example, he was just a student and not a student. but my personal opinion- I know enough people who say that it bothers me that and I feel somehow excluded from just not generally a good thing for all people who do n't have that personally. instead of it's just always contextual, depending on whether you're talking about what you're talking about. it can be that you're only talking about boys or only about girls. In addition to being different, the team doesn't have the fluency of the language it's a bit difficult or that students have to get used to it. I think because we haven't done it either, we'll use it for a few years. then it's completely normal if everyone genders every word. so I do makes it easier.",

        "transcript": "we are directly talking about undermining God's plan as he has revealed it to us. we're replacing his authority with our own. if marriage is no longer between one man and one woman, are we open to the idea of polygamy? we disregard the heterosexual aspect, so why not the monogamous aspect too? if love is love, as we keep hearing, who is to say that three men loving each other is not more love? the two men loving each other? and I'm sure someone in this chamber has echoed the words Love Is Love Tonight. and this is not about love being loved. this is about marriage, the sacrament of holy matrimony. it is directly connected to love, but it's not the definition of love. too many people are to those words and confuse the meaning of Love. Agape, the Biblical context of Love, is a Divine love. it's a sacrificial love. it's not lustful. people often conflate sex with love. it's very disingenuous. we've heard quite a bit of that. but then, of course, atheists often part the words God is love, and we've heard that one tonight too, again without any understanding. yes, God is love, but he sets the terms, not us. another one we've heard plenty of is inclusivity. should the church be more inclusive? again, it's a play of works. it's it's virtue- signaling this- to appear good rather than to be good. the church should absolutely be inclusive. Christ spent time with tax collectors and prostitutes, but it is they who went away changed, not Christ. we are Fallen, therefore we are all sinners. the church is open to Sinners- of course it is. that's the purpose of the church, but it should not be to encourage people to continue to sin. our duty as clerics is to help lead people to Christ, to lead them away from sin, not to embrace it, not to affirm it. I know many LGBT people who live lives in Christ. they abstain from sexual gratification to be closer to God, and it's not easy. it really isn't. it's perhaps not fair, but it is right and it is good. and these people are being let down. I've had people crying saying I could have got married, but I did what the church taught me was right, and now the church is saying they were wrong. all along I've wasted my life as Christians. we're called to be in the world, but not of the world. in the secular world, we already have equality and law. people can enter civil Partnerships or even gay marriage outside of the church, and that's their prerogative. however, the faith is inherently discriminatory. God is discriminatory. he sets conditions on us entering his Heavenly Kingdom. it is not a free-for-all. we must turn away from sin, repent and follow Christ. and I want to specify: it is the sin that is the problem, not the sinner. every single person is loved by God and God forgives all of us of our depravity. but we have to turn away from our sins and turn toward him. and it seems the panel opposite me has forgotten to separate the sin from The Sinner. one can denounce sin while still welcoming The Sinner. so, as I wrap up, my message to the proposing side is: do not lead us astray. do not lead people astray. do not be the wolves in sheep's clothing. do not be the false teachers the Bible warns us about. remember your obligation to defend the faith. stop teaching about diversity, inclusion and equality and get back to teaching about Redemption and salvation. this is spiritual neglect. help people by telling them the truth. be kind to People by supporting them through those struggles and reminding them that Christ suffers with them, and be compassionate by Leading them to Christ when the world tries to lead them away from him. the church is imploding and the faithful masses have stopped turning up on Sundays and we are seeing the most rapid decline of Christianity in this country that we may have ever seen. do not accelerate it with heresy. you do not have the authority to bless sin. when I hear the bishop of London on record saying these new prayers will mean priests can bless same-sex relationships, some of which may be sexual in nature, I hear the devil at work. Bishops are promoting the idea of sacramental sodomy. let them be anathema, repent. and to the rest of you, I have no doubt that some of you will consider me a bigot or a transpho or a homophobe, but I am neither of those things, none of those things. I'm simply a follower of Christ, a Christian, and we are naturally counter-cultural. and if so-called liberals were truly diverse and tolerant, they would Embrace us just as they Embrace everyone else. and the point has been made. but the growing christopheric attitude around this public debate and the Ugly level of hypocrisy is that we really see people hold Muslims and people of other faiths to the same expectations that they hold Christians to. who is calling for the Quran to be updated to Modern societal Norms? the same patronizing attitude of people of other that treat other faiths, patronize other face while being intolerant towards Christians at the same time, it's a shame, but in the words of saint athanasius of Alexandria, if the world is against the truth, the name against the world.

He says love is patient and kind. love does not in Envy or boast, it is not arrogant or rude, it does not insist on its own way, it is not irritable or resentful and- this is the key verse- it does not rejoice at wrongdoing but rejoices with the truth. so when you go to a wedding, a gay wedding, you're rejoicing at wrongdoing and it is, it's, it's I, and I talked about this before I, when I first got saved, my two agents at William Morris invited me, or one of them it was a, uh, was is a gay man and he was getting married to another man and he, they, he- invited me and I was put on the spot. we were at dinner. we were at dinner and one of the agents- she said, she turned to me and she said: you're going to- let's call him Joe, you're going to Joe's wedding, right, and I- and I thought at the time because I was a brand new Christian, I didn't know what to say and I was put on the spot. I was like, yes, of course I'm going, because I thought that was the loving thing to do. and, uh, it was. so I ended up going to the wedding. it was such a big mistake and I went because once I got there, it was all the way out somewhere far. it was like Malibu, but not Malibu or somewhere out there. and and I remember just walking in and seeing all the people coming and dressed up and everyone's so kind of happy and I was thinking, oh my gosh, wait, I'm here celebrating a wedding between a marriage between two men, and it really hit me hard and I I had a really difficult time that night. uh, and I and it taught me that was a very good lesson to me, because it I I learned that that loving people doesn't mean going to their gay wedding. in fact, in fact, as Christians, I believe that we should not go to gay like, if it's your son, your daughter, your niece who have, whomever, you should not attend the wedding, because it's first of all, my being at this wedding years ago was probably really confusing to some people there, because some of the people there knew I was a Christian and they probably thought, oh, like Beckett's here. so I guess this is all good, everything's okay, so it's it's a terrible witness to Christ. uh, so to go to it and it's also your celebrating sin is basically what you're doing. you're celebrating sin, you're in engaging in that celebration, and and so I? I, in my opinion, I think that Christians should not attend gay weddings. um, there may be some crazy circumstance where you can, but I and I, I would never, I would never go to a gay wedding again in my life. I will never go. um. and now you can. there's ways around that. you can tell the person who's having the wedding. if it's your niece who's having the wedding, I say, you can say: I love you, I, I absolutely love you, but I have these convictions about what marriage is and I, I cannot, I cannot go against my conscience. it is neither safe nor what. uh, what does Martin Luther say? it is neither safe nor uh- I can't remember the rest of the quote- when he's at the, the diet of vorms, um, but when he's asked to recant. but there's other ways to, to, to love your niece or whomever. you can go to dinner with your niece and your niece's friend, or whatever you can. you can invite them over to dinner. I mean, ask Rosario Butterfield, like that's how she ended up coming to faith in Christ. her past, the pastor and his wife kept inviting her over for dinner. her neighbor and kept inviting her over for dinner and and just basically loving on her for a long- I think it was over a year- and that's that's how we should do it and we can, you know, say, say to our loved one, or say to our family: remember, hey, like I love you so much, but I can't be a part of this, but I would love to have you guys over for dinner, I would love to take you guys out to dinner, I would love to. you know it's whatever, Etc. there are many other ways to to love your, your family members who are in the lgbtq community, um, and but going to the wedding, uh, for me, going to the wedding is a Red Line in the Sand because it's it's dishonoring to God, it's a confusing witness and it is. I think it's just bad for for you, as a Christian, to to engage and because you, it's like, it's like Romans 1, where Paul says: not only do they do such things, they give approval to those who do. so. you're, Your Presence at this wedding is almost kind of giving approval to what's happening, and so that's why I say it is uh, it's no bueno. so I hope that helped.

        "transcript": "[Applause] [Music]. [Applause] [Music]. [Applause] foreign. I was going to say thank you for the warm introduction, but I think instead I'll say thank you for the invitation. that's far more charitable. um, it's a genuine pleasure to speak here this evening. it really is. I'm happy to be back at the Oxford Union- it wasn't too long ago that I was based here myself- and I'm very happy to be part of an organization that is still standing up for free speech, still standing up for diversity of thought and opinion, going against the approved Narrative of Academia in the 21st century. so well done to you all for that. now, I genuinely struggled with this one. I've struggled sleeping this week. actually, I've. I don't get stage rights. I'd never get nervous when I go on television. I recently debated at the Cambridge Union and the Durham Union. no problem whatsoever. but this, there's something different about this one. it's been causing me anxiety. so someone kindly sent me Luke, chapter 12, verses 11 to 12, saying: and when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities, do not be anxious about how you should defend yourself and what you should say, for the holy spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say. I know there's something a bit ironic about me coming here with a speech after that, but why do I feel anxiety about this? well, we are up against the authorities, three bishops from the established church. that means either I am wrong and Christians have been teaching incorrectly for the last two thousand years, or and Jews and Christians for the last four to six thousand years, or we have church leaders attempting to drag the church into apostasy. neither way is good. the consequences are severe. this debate is not just happening in this chamber. this debate is happening in real time in the house of Bishops. as we speak, there's a growing number of vocal Bishops who want to change the term, the church's teaching on marriage, the results being the spiritual neglect of anglicans up and down this country. now I may have trained at the last remaining sound Anglican Seminary up the road, as in Steven's house, but I am a newbie deacon so perhaps I am on. I am wrong on this. let's consult people wiser than myself, starting with the church fathers. Saint Thomas Aquinas, in his summer theological, quite clearly identifies matrimony as being between one man and one woman, beneficial for begetting of children and for the good of Offspring, for both educational and developmental purposes, necessary for the Perfection of the community and for the worship of God. Saint Paul describes marriage as, therefore, a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife and they become one flesh, in which he is mirroring the language of Genesis, where God tells man and woman to be fruitful and multiply. both Aquinas and Paul refer to matrimony as a sacrament, a holy mystery in which one man and one woman are joined together in conjugal Union, with the potential to be blessed, by the grace of God, With Children to start a family for the worship of God. people will often argue in this debate: we know more about homosexuality now than we did then. maybe so, but are we really going to suggest that God knew less than than we know now? for either all of scripture is God breathed or it isn't. either we believe Christ or we don't. so let's refer to another source, the book of common prayer. one of the Anglican formula is an authority of liturgy and catechism in the Anglican Church. the prayer book lists three ordained reasons for matrimony. first, it was ordained for the procreation of children, to be brought up in the fear and nature of the Lord and to praise His holy name. second, it was ordained for a remedy against sin and to avoid fornication, that such persons, as had not the gift of constancy, might marry and keep themselves undefiled members of the church's body. and thirdly, it was ordained for the mutual Society help and comfort that one ought to have the other, both in prosperity and adversity. if we look wider abroad to the church Catholic, which defines in the catechism of the Catholic Church, matrimony: the matroneal confidence by which a man and a woman, established between themselves a partnership of the whole life, is by the nature ordered toward the good of the spouses and the procreation and education of Offspring. this Covenant between baptized persons has been raised by Christ, the Lord, to the Dignity of a sacrament. this is referred to as marriage in God's plan. so are we looking to alter the catechism of just Anglican church, or the Catholic Church too? should? should they all get with the times? two thousand years of Christian doctrine cannot be altered at the whim of a few liberal Bishops. what is God ordained cannot be adjusted to suit our new liberal, Progressive views. marriage is heterosexual and monogamous and should be open to the possibility of children. the Bible backs all of this up. it's very clear throughout on this matter, whether it's nine verses or 32 000 verses, marriages between one man and one woman for the purposes of procreation, sex outside of marriage, is a sin, and that is the same for heterosexuals as it is for homosexuals, although the Bible is quite clear that same-sex relations are abhorrent- and before some smart alec starts us asking me the question of whether I'm wearing mixed Fabrics, there is a difference between the moral laws and ceremonial laws, and Christ did come to fulfill the Old laws. both the issues of marriage and homosexuality, however, are still addressed in the New Testament, in Paul's Epistles, but also in the Gospels. Jesus does talk of marriage in Mark and Matthew, both in the context of heterosexual Union. so my question to the Bishops would be: do we not believe in the authority of scriptures anymore? can we pick and choose which parts of the Gospel we adhere to? the church, after all, is Christ's Sprite. as we heard earlier, Jesus is described as the bridegroom, so that we may know how he relates to us. two Grooms would be pointless. Christ is already in Union with the father and the Holy Spirit. it's us he's inviting in. two Brides is what we're looking at here. the church is attempting to marry itself and to leave Christ out of the picture. we are directly talking about undermining God's plan as he has revealed it to us. we're replacing his authority with our own. if marriage is no longer between one man and one woman, are we open to the idea of polygamy? we disregard the heterosexual aspect, so why not the monogamous aspect too? if love is love, as we keep hearing, who's to say that three men loving each other is not more love? the two men loving each other? [Music]. shame, and I'm sure someone in this chamber has echoed the words Love Is Love Tonight. and this is not about love being loved. this is about marriage, the sacrament of holy matrimony. it is directly connected to love, but it's not the definition of love. too many people are to those words and confuse the meaning of Love. Agape, the Biblical context of Love, is a Divine love. it's a sacrificial love. it's not lustful. people often conflate sex with love. it's very disingenuous. we heard quite a bit of that. but then, of course, atheists. often part of the words God is love, and we've heard that one tonight too, again without any understanding. yes, God is love, but he sets the terms, not us. another one we've heard plenty of is inclusivity. should the church be more inclusive? again, it's a play of works. it's, it's virtue signaling it's to appear good rather than to be good. the church should absolutely be inclusive. Christ spent time with tax collectors and prostitutes, but it is they who went away changed, not Christ. we are Fallen, therefore we are all sinners. the church is open to Sinners. of course it is. that's the purpose of the church, but it should not be to encourage people to continue to sin. our duty as clerics is to help lead people to Christ, to lead them away from sin, not to embrace it, not to affirm it. I know many LGB people. I know many LGBT people who live lives in Christ. they abstain from sexual gratification to be closer to God, and it's not easy. it really isn't. it's perhaps not fair, but it is right and it is good. and these people are being let down. I've had people crying saying I could have got married, but I did what the church taught me was right. and now the church is saying they were wrong. all along I've wasted my life as Christians. we're called to be in the world, but not of the world. the Trap that we're falling into in this debate is looking at the church Through The Eyes Of The World rather than through his kingdom. in the secular world, we already have equality and law. people can enter civil Partnerships or even gay marriage outside of the church, and that's their prerogative. however, the faith is inherently discriminatory. God is discriminatory. he sets conditions on us entering his Heavenly Kingdom. it is not a free-for-all. we must turn away from sin, repent and follow Christ. and I want to specify: it is the sin that is the problem, not the sinner. every single person is loved by God and God forgives all of us of our depravity, but we have to turn away from our sins and turn toward him. and it seems the panel opposite me has forgotten to separate the sin from The Sinner. one can denounce sin while still welcoming The Sinner. so, as I wrap up, my message to the proposing side is: do not lead us astray. do not lead people astray. do not be the wolves in sheep's clothing. do not be the false teachers that the Bible warns us about. remember your obligation to defend the faith. stop teaching about diversity, inclusion and equality and get back to teaching about Redemption and salvation. this is spiritual neglect. help people by telling them the truth. be kind to People by supporting them through those struggles and reminding them that Christ suffers with them, and be compassionate by Leading them to Christ when the world tries to lead them away from him. the church is imploding and the faithful masses have stopped turning up on Sundays and we are seeing the most rapid decline of Christianity in this country that we may have ever seen. do not accelerate it with heresy. you do not have the authority to bless sin. when I hear the bishop of London on record saying these new prayers will mean priests can bless same-sex relationships, some of which may be sexual in nature, I hear the devil at work. Bishops are promoting the idea of sacramental sodomy. let them be anathema, repent. and to the rest of you, I have no doubt that some of you will consider me a bigot or a transfer or a homophobe, but I am neither of those things, none of those things. I'm simply a follower of Christ, a Christian, and we are naturally counter-cultural. and if so-called liberals were truly diverse and tolerant, they would Embrace us just as they Embrace everyone else, and that not right now. I'm just wrapping up and the point has been made, but the growing christopheric attitude around this public debate and the Ugly level of hypocrisy is that we really see people hold Muslims and people have other faiths to the same expectations that they hold Christians to. who is calling- except my good friend here- for Islam to embrace gay marriage? who is calling for the Quran to be updated to Modern societal norms? it is the same mind, your language. it is the same patronizing attitude of people of other that treat other faiths, patronize other Faith, while being intolerant towards Christians at the same time. it's a shame, but in the words of saint athanasius of Alexandria, if the world is against the truth, the name against the world. thank you very much. foreign [Music].",

        "transcript": "the literature of the ancient world, particularly starting in the Bronze Age, is full, if not rich, of all sorts of mentions of homerotic attraction in general. samex relationships, in other words, samesex attraction, is definitely not a modern invention. it's not a modern thing, and I want to go out on a limb and say it's probably as ancient as mankind itself. but what about homosexual marriage or, in general, same-sex marriage? is that a modern invention, or do we have evidence of homosexual marriages in the ancient period? as I have demonstrated over and over again on this channel, this is the one channel that does not have any agenda and does not try to push any ideology. namely, I tell it how it is. so what do the sources say? let's talk about it. hello Noble ones, welcome back to my channel. this is the Metatron speaking, and one of the earliest, most explicit examples and mentions of a homoerotic relationship is between the Mesopotamian hero gilgames and his lover en kidu. the theme and the idea of the hero and His companion at arms, connected by a brotherly love so deep as to enter the sphere of sexual attraction, is in fact a pretty common element in several Classics in ancient literature, sometimes explicit, other times less so. it of course goes without say that, even in the ancient period, brotherly love or friendship in arms doesn't always or necessarily mean that we are in the presence of homoerotic Attraction. however, different cultures understood this sort of love in very different ways throughout the centuries and since. today, our question is rather specific, since we actually want to know about marriage, so something that is institutionalized within a society by law. our investigation will not only be interdisciplinary, but we will be discussing several civilizations. in fact, these five: the ancient Romans, the ancient Greeks, Mesopotamia, the Hittites and ancient [Music] Egypt. when talking about same-sex relationships in the ancient world, one of the things we need to understand is that there are several aspects that need to be taken into consideration in order to make sure that we don't fall into the easy mistake of just expecting homosexual relationships to be understood, approached and lived in the same way. they would be, not only now specifically, but in general, for example, in the 20th century. to understand how same-sex love was perceived by the Ancients, we need to discuss this topic from an anthropological, cultural and ritualistic aspect. but with that out of the way, one thing we can absolutely state with confidence is that the Ancients were not ex strenuous to the concepts of same-sex love, but such relationships were not as free as one might expect, as they were in fact regulated by specific societal conventions, which would render them lawful in some situations and illicit in other situations, sometimes frowned upon by society and other times encouraged or used to boast. to be more specific, passive homosexuality tended to be stigmatized and only considered to be lawful, according to at least some people, either for the very young, like in the case of some Greeks, or the very old, as it would be the case for the Norse. this could be considered to be a generalization of the condition of same-sex relationships in the ancient world, drawn in Broad lines, and it acts as a basis for our next question, which is the title of this video. what about same seex marriage? within the Mesopotamian world? the question relating to homosexual marriage isn't the clearest one. in fact, the type of information we have in general en on this topic when it comes to the past is rather fragmentary, but we do have some magic formula, which we find present in the almanac of incantation from the second millennium BC, that can give us some very interesting information on this topic. it appears, in fact, that these forms of magical incantations favored love between a man and a woman, a woman to a man, but also of a man towards another man, and, regardless of how interesting of a piece of information this may be, it does not specifically talk about a legalized marriage in the sense of a contract. the first explicit reference to a homosexual marriage during the Bronze Age comes from the hittite world. the first tablet of the hittite laws, created between 1,650 BC to 1,500 BC, was specifically used for regulatory legislations when it comes to matrimony, and it talks specifically about the rules when it comes of the payment of the dowy, so an amount of money from the husband to the wife or the wife's family. special Arrangements present and discussed in tablet one conceded explicit legal Authority also to Slaves when it comes to pruiting a wife to themselves. we read: if a slave gives a DIY to a woman and takes her as a wife, no one must force him to give her back. this is from section 34. now check out section 36. if a slave gives the dowy to a young man and takes him to live with him in his own house as his spouse, no one must force him to give him back. so what this means is that, at least in the hittite world, if a male slave was going to give money to another man because he wanted to marry him, then this transaction would have been legal and protected by the law. now, unfortunately, the only piece of evidence we have is this one, specifically talking about slaves. but then again, if slaves are allowed to do something, logically speaking, in the majority of cases it can also be implied that a free man could have done the same within that Society. now, when we approach classical literature and specific political discussions on the ancient world, both in ancient Rome and in ancient Greece, the idea of homosexual love is mentioned, talked about all over the place, specifically in Plateau, but this does not mean that the ancient Greeks would have been favorable to the idea of homosexual marriage. in fact, it is in ancient Rome that we find the only actual examples of homosexual marriage between men, and they are both trying to portray the homosexual marriages of Emperor Nero and the homosexual marriages of Emperor elagabalus. now, when it comes to- I said it once in Latin, I'm just going to say it in English- elagabalus, when it comes to him, I have a dedicated video, so I'm not going to go into it again. you'll find a link in the description below, but since that video was dedicated to elagabalus. I did not mention Nero. Nero did marry a man. let's read it. this is reported by Casio Dio and it talks about how, after the death of his wife Sabina, whom he himself had killed out of anger since he was missing her- he decided to marry a woman, a young woman that looked like her. after which, however, he had a young libertus castrated. his name was sporo because he also looked like Sabina- and treated him in any way as a wife with time, even though he had already been married to a Liberto by the name of pagora. Nero formerly married sporo and gave him a dowy according to contract law law. so, if you notice, not only we have a mention of a marriage that is formally done through the law, but we have a mention of a marriage before with another libertus by the name of pagora. in that specific case, casuso is mentioning tagus. so, even though we do have evidence of homosexual marriage, these, as we read them through the literature and the perspective of the time, are always considered as a form of Extravaganza. these not only are not the norm, but we have no reason to believe the regular people. people had access to such exotic behaviors, and when I say exotic, I specifically talk about elagabalus, but also Nero. so what I'm trying to say is: these are Emperors, they're powerful men and they could do whatever they wanted, including defying a stablish law or established customs, and nobody could say anything, well until they kill the gabas, that is. and when it comes to the extravagant nature of such unions. still, we are told that during this first marriage between emperor Rano and the libertus Pitagora, they had a feast, and what we are told during The Chronicles of this event is that all sorts of very promiscuous activities occurred. we read: Naro, himself, contaminated by all sorts of natural and innatural desires, did not save any Abomination to complete his depraved existence, and after a few days he became officially, with all the rights and legitimacy of marriage, the wife of pagora. a covered, the Imperial head, Witnesses were invited to the place. the dowy, the marriage bed, the marriage torches were all there. everything in substance that a woman would want as she became a wife was given and openly showed. now, did this actually happen? I'm inclined to believe so, mostly because we have more than one mention, as we see. we have the indirect mention of casuso, we have the direct mention of takus, but on top of that, suetonius mentions this as well, even though he doesn't give the Liberto the name pagora, but calls him tororo. however, it's important to underline that, as we read these sources, they're clearly trying to paint the Emperors in the most negative light possible, but regardless of that, still there is precedent. this allegedly happened. so what about the regular people? could people who do not have the power of an emperor marry a person of the same sex if they so chose? legally speaking, Roman legislation does not seem to contemplate or include the possibility of homosexual marriage, and the situation with narrow does seem to be a form of extravagant Behavior. regardless of that, there is one passage that I think could be very interesting to mention, and that is from the theodosian code of 342 ad. this is once again a law that kind of depicts the situation of homosexual marriage in negative light. I mean this happens a lot. same seex attract, that people always had to struggle throughout the centuries. that is a fact, and trying to say otherwise does not do any favor to anyone. however, there are two possible interpretation of this law, so I want to give them both regardless. in the first interpretation or translation of this law, it would be a legislation or a maneuver that is trying to prohibit homosexual marriage. so if the government feels the need to prohibit something, it means that very thing was in fact done by the people, and at least to a certain numerical level, to have them involved. however, a secondary interpretation of this law gives us the idea that perhaps they weren't trying to ban homosexual marriage, but homosexual relationships instead. now, which one is the correct translation? very difficult to know, so I'll leave them both to you for your own personal research. now that we have discussed the ancient world, there is a thing or two that we have to say about the medieval period. now, clearly, in medieval Europe, with the rise of Christianity, homosexual relationships become something that needs to be done in secret. so samex Slavs have to hide it or be persecuted for it. with that being said, if you are familiar with not only legal codex but specifically ecclesiastic ones, you might have heard a word: adelo poesis. let's talk about it. within medieval archival history, it is possible to run into a certain type of document which specifically talks about a kind of legal Union between two men, ratified within the ecclesiastical World. these would include the creation of a very strong relationship, which also had economic implications, and the men that were joining in these kind of reports were promising to take care of each other, to share their income and work equally. and what's interesting about the adelo poesis is that it also worked as a will, in the sense that if one of the two men were to Die, the other one would inherit at least part of the other man's Heritage or patrimony. so, at least from a formal perspective, the practice of adelo poesis does remind us very much in its structure, that of marriage, and there is a specific historiographical modern school of thought that supports this idea, the main representative Being John Boswell, from the University of Yale. he is one of the first to propose the idea of identifying this specific kind of Union with an actual homosexual Union. it is, however, important to say that this specific position is not shared by the majority of historians. that is because they consider adelo poesis as an institutionalized form of political, commercial joint venture, military establishment or even brotherly love. and what's interesting is that the origins of such a union between men was not in fact to be found within the Christian Church of the medieval period, but instead in the Pagan pre-existing cultures, mostly in Eastern Europe, within the Orthodox church, but also within the Catholic church in the west, the atmology of the word also meaning to make a brother. and even though there are definitely connection to the central Slavic world, as I was mentioned, there is at least one occurrence that we know of within the ecclesiastical Catholic World, exemplified in a document found in the monastery of sanova in Spain, which today can be observed in the hisor National Archive of Madrid: a union between Pedro the and Muno van, stipulated on the 16th of April 1061. it is my opinion that, as a societal, specifically ecclesiastical practice, this was not intended to be sexual in nature, also because it is often underlined that such unions were to be similar to those of the Saints. with that being said, I would like to leave you with this thought for you to ponder: considering the fact that, as we said, homosexual couples and same-sex attraction and love absolutely existed in the medieval period in needed to be kept secret, is it really so impossible to believe that perhaps Sun men used this structure, pretending for it to be some sort of Brotherly Love, But in reality they were an actual couple. they just didn't tell the church. having a look in the world of ancient Egypt and trying to understand how the situ ation was, well, we don't have a lot of testimonies that really tell us about a specific legal ability to marry, for example, another man or for a woman to marry another woman. however, there is an indirect mentioning which we might want to look at. a certain level of connection and interaction between the ancient Israelites in biblical literature and ancient Egypts is well known and specifically in The Book of Leviticus, we have some mentions of homosexuality within the biblical text, which we are now discussing from a secular perspective only now, rather than reading The Book of Leviticus itself, which is something I usually do on this channel, jumping directly into Interlinear. so we normally examine word by word the Hebrew text, but that's for a separate series. by the way, Link in the description to the episodes, if you're interested. the connection I have to today's topic has to do with Rabin literature. instead, in the book of cifra, as a comment com AR, we could say to the information and Commandments given in The Book of Leviticus, we read: you will not copy the practices of the land of Egypt and of the land of Canaan and you will not follow their laws. so what are these laws? well, let's read: a man would marry a man and a woman would marry a woman and a man would marry a woman and her daughter or a woman being married by two men. so if we were to believe that this interpretation and examination of The Book of Leviticus, which we find in the cifra, it would point us to the idea that both Egyptians and canans by law allowed these kind of marriages to happen. it is, however, important to underline the fact that, since this is a book that was created externally to the cultures that we are discussing, we don't know if this was some sort of slander or an attempt at discussing Customs that the author was trying to push as inappropriate specifically because foreign. so it's a pretty weak point of reference, but I thought it was interesting to mention. well, as always, let me know what you think about this very question and, in general, this topic in the comments below, as always. thank you so much for watching. not a member of this community become a no one. subscribe to my channel for more content from the Metatron and remember the Metatron has spread his wings. goodbye.",

        "transcript": "I just don't see how a gay marriage in any way damages a straight marriage. a while back, conservative commentator Matt Walsh was on Joe Rogan's podcast and they got into a whole debate about gay marriage. it is here that I think Matt Walsh made a crucial mistake. let's dive in and maybe you'll see it too. I think of marriage is is a certain thing which is the um, the context for uh, for procreation, for the, for the, the building of the, the nuclear family. what about people that get married that don't have kids? are you opposed to that? what if they get married? they decide: you know, we don't need kids, I'm going to get fixed. you get your tubes tied. let's travel the world. well, what do you mean? am I opposed to it? I mean, I I think that, uh, that every married couple should be open to life. but what if they don't want to? do you opposed to them being married? if marriage is only for procreation and to bond a family together, what about people that are deeply in love that never want to have children? I don't think it's. it's not only procreation, but that is one of the fundamental definitional, uh aspects of it. uh, of course, there's more to marriage just than that? and what about people that are infertile? at the end of the day, we're talking about definitions and Foundations. the key questions that we're asking here is: what is marriage and how do we know what marriage is? people love to debate the first question, go back and forth in debate, and yet Clarity really comes in the second question: how do we know what marriage is? what is your foundation? that is where we get the definition. you see, I've appreciated some of Matt Walsh's content and, based on what I've seen, he maybe identifies as a Christian or a Catholic, but yet here he fails to identify his foundation. now, on the other hand, if you've watched Joe Rogan, you recognize that he really has no Foundation at all. you'd be hard-pressed to find any kind of consistent world view coming out of his podcast, but, as we'll see here, Matt Walsh loses all of his leverage because he abandons his foundation. to get on the same level as Joe Rogan, here, Matt chooses to utilize the argument that marriage is between a man and a woman because of procreation. now, I totally believe that the reality that procreation can only take place between a man and a woman is a clear indication of God's ultimate design. but when, then, you look at Joe Rogan's world view. for him it's like: okay, so watch, they can have children. good for them. how does that impact a gay couple that just wants to get married? you know, that's just who cares. we go back to foundations again. is there an objective command or standard that we need to return to? is there even a God that made us with intention and a particular purpose and design? to Matt's Point, yes, God designed it. that married couples- one man, one woman- would bring new life into this world, but even before children. he made it so that the man and the woman would be a play, a glorious, Divine Play of God, that the bride would represent the church and that the husband would represent Christ. that it would be a beautiful, God glorifying Union, even before children. that man should leave his father and his mother and become one flesh with his wife. why? well, you might not want to hear this answer, but because God designed it that way and we, as Christians, need to be willing to stand on God's word as authoritative. God's word and his foundation will not return void, for the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing the divisions of the soul and the spirit of joints and of marrow and Discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart. it's a personal choice in that. I'm not advocating for, like a law that says that you, if you're a marriage, you have to have, you have to have X number of kids. um, but then why are you opposed to two gay people doing that? well, because, because, again, it's. it's. it's not about Choice, it's about what this institution, marriage is an institution, and what is it and what purpose does it serve? and I, I do not agree with, um tearing down or or changing this definition, especially because the people who have changed the definition haven't come up with a new one. so they they say, well, that's not what marriage is. so for thousands of years we said marriage is the procreative Union. and then we had the other side came along and said, well, it's not that okay. well then, like, what is it exactly? and I know you said, well, it's people who love each other. two people love each other. but then why two people? why do they have to love each other? um, you know all these kinds of questions. okay, so here Matt Walsh is basically verbalizing the stable Society argument that marriage between a man and a woman produces the most stable, flourishing societies and families and culture in general, and I don't disagree with that. but this is the primary argument that I would make. no, like I said, I'm the foundations guy, I don't want to just be pragmatic. and Matt Walsh's argument? he's saying that this is what we've done forever, it's worked. why change it? and then you get those on the Progressive side, as always, that put forward numbers of reasons on why they should change it. this is always the battle between conservatives and progressives that conservatives are saying: you know, we should do this because this is always how we've done it, and progressives say, well, we need to push it because we've been doing it wrong. this is why I want to rely on the foundation and the structure of scripture, not just traditions of man and thinking that, oh, this is the way we've always done it, so that must mean they're good, because that's not even necessarily true. ultimately, I want to be holding to the word, word of God. that's why these things are beneficial. that's why we should be clinging to these things. notice the difference in Ultimate Authority. is it the pragmatic results that, oh man, this benefits our culture, so let's do it this way- or is it the word of God and what God has said is that our ultimate Authority is the highest determining factor of our morality, a positive outcome, or is it abiding by what God ordained? okay, I know what you're saying. what about all those people that don't care what God has to say? what about they? they don't want to honor God. I believe that obedience comes out of a restored relationship with God, and so when we're talking unbelievers, honestly I'm not too concerned about trying to convince them that same-sex marriage is wrong. I want to convince them that they are a guilty and a sinner before God. I mean, ultimately, with the conviction of the holy spirit that draws them to that conclusion, but I want to tell them like, hey, this is, this is the problem that you have in your life and this is how you can have a restored relationship with God, and then through that, they actually want to pursue obedience and what God has commanded of them, because I believe when somebody submits their life to God in that way, all those other dominoes will fall. this next part is interesting. Matt Walsh makes reference to the fact that they don't actually have a new definition, these progressives that are saying, oh, why can't we just have gay marriage? they don't have another definition of what marriage is. so wouldn't that mean that just anything could go about? and you know, five dudes could get married and three ladies, and three ladies and five cisgender and non-binary people could all get married. it's like what's going on here. you don't have another definition. but honestly, that kind of slippery slope argument really only works if those on the other side are concerned about what's down the slope. but honestly, I, in our culture, I don't think, based on what I'm seeing in media and entertainment and culture, that they're too concerned about what's down the slope. in a lot of ways, I think this argument would have been effective like 10 years ago, because then you start telling people: oh man, like where is this gonna go? is there going to be all sorts of weird marriages that are taking place because the, the standards, the boundaries have been taken off and people might, yeah, equally be concerned. yeah, well, no, no, it's just this one thing that we got going on and, yeah, all that other stuff is bad these days. I don't believe so, based on what I'm seeing, I don't think it's going to be long before we have men and boys that people come forward and say, hey, look, the boy's mature. or like it's okay, like it's all consensual. I don't think it's gonna be too long before we're seeing something like that and, honestly, that's why I'm much more concerned about individual transformation. so they begin to see sin as sin, because when you reject God's objective moral standard, all your left is with your own devices, your own opinions, your own subjective standards, and so who's to say that it's just not going to continue to go down? that's why you need heart transformation. so then you want to cling on to what God has told us to do. as some of you know, I just quit my job, so I am full time in this ministry, and that is so exciting because I love equipping people to follow Jesus daily through the social media content on YouTube, Tick Tock, Instagram. it's my passion, it's what I love and through the support of people on patreon, that is is able to be a possibility. if you want to get behind what I'm doing, that would be amazing. if you want to get behind the mission, or just you just really enjoy the content, it would be a huge blessing to me. so check out the link in my description. there are all sorts of perks on there. we do video calls, there's exclusive videos, there is merch discounts and there is a Discord, so there's a lot of things for you to check out when you are part of that Community. it would be an amazing, amazing blessing. so check it out down below and we'll get back into the video. I just don't see how a gay marriage in any way damages a straight marriage. I don't, I don't see it at all. it doesn't make any sense to me. it just seems to me that people want to be. look, if you, if you wanted to look at logic, especially in our modern society, which is pretty when it comes to relationships, it's somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 of all marriage is in a divorce anyway. they don't make it. you know if why. I don't know if anything would damage marriage and damage the institution of marriage, it's the option of divorce. I don't think gay people and gay people getting married in any way, shape or form changes a bond that you have with your wife. it's just called marriage. it's a human, invented thing. if we decide that gay people can get married too, I just don't see how it damages anything. I don't think it tears down the definition of marriage in any way. it just opens up the possibility that people who are gay won't be discriminated against. now here Joe Rogan tries to point out some of the apparent cracks with the pragmatic argument against same-sex marriage. he points out the divorce rate and he says: hey, look at the rampant divorce rate. it looks like straight marriage isn't super good for society either, because of all the broken families running around. now you might come back with a rebuttal that the divorce numbers are hyper-inflated, especially within the church, and it's not as bad. but now you're just getting in the debate of Statistics. the fundamental questions are not: does it work or doesn't it? does it impact does? does it have an effect on our life? how does it impact Society like? these are important questions to ask in general, but they're not the primary question that we should be asking. to get to the fundamental moral root of this issue, first and foremost, we need to be asking: is it right or isn't it? and if you want to go more in depth about what God says about homosexuality, check the video links up here. we are making the institution meaningless, but it's not meaningless. it's very meaningful to the people that have it subjective, symbolic, and it's about your own personal feelings, isn't it, though? well, no, I I would say that it's not, it's well, if it's not subjective and it's not symbolic, it it codifies and protects and, uh, gives a name to a, a thing that actually exists, which is which are, you know, man, woman, couples, creating people, creating, creating babies- um, but not always. I could just feel that Matt Walsh was getting so close to identifying his foundation. he knew it wasn't subjective, he knew it wasn't just this fluffy thing that man created, and yet he didn't want to identify why he knew that or how he knew that or how he wanted to support that belief that it wasn't just a man-made thing. if I were talking to Joe Rogan, I would say no, it's not just subjective, symbolic, man-made. it is ordained by God. God created us and he set this up as a picture of who he is and what he wants to do on this Earth and his relationship with us, and it's this beautiful connection and covenantal relationship that he has ordained in a particular way for his glory. so, no, it's not just whatever you want it to be. this is what God has said. now you might be saying: well, Joe doesn't believe in the Bible, so why would you use the Bible to back up your arguments? and my question for you is why would you abandon the foundation, the Firm Foundation that you're standing on on, to get on somebody else's house of sinking sand just to have a debate with them? that makes no sense. you're losing all of your leverage. you're losing what truth you're standing on. now. there's a piece in the scripture where it says: answer a fool according to his folly, where you draw out the full ramifications of what that person is saying. you be consistent according to their world view. that's a solid practice. but if you're never taking them from that place of inconsistency, of of just absurdity, into actual truth, you're missing out. no, Joe asked an important question. he says: what does a gay couple have to do with you and your marriage? how does that affect you? Matt Walsh says: well, nothing. actually. it's just kind of a more cultural scale, because right now they're arguing about kind of cultural ramifications. right now they're arguing about pragmatic results of these decisions. so they're saying, hey, like if there's a gay person, there's a gay couple that get married and gets married, nothing's really going to happen to culture. and the other person is saying, no, that would be really really bad for culture. we gotta ask what is the ideal end for this kind of debate or this kind conversation. is it just to win somebody over to the gospel of societal Improvement or personal life Improvement to say, oh, you know what? the same-sex marriage? it will damage culture in some ways. and they say, oh, you know what? you're actually right. I want Society to be a good, uplifting, fulfilling place. so I agree with you. is that the end result. that would be ideal for all of us. my goal isn't to just win somebody over to moral principles or biblical principles, because ultimately they have better impacts on culture in general. so you should be for them. I want them to place their lives and their hearts in submission to God so that all those other dominoes fall into place. that they want to honor God with their lives and how they act and with their marriages and how they Orient everything about themselves. that we can obey God in his commands, trust that they are ultimately, yes, best for culture. but even when we can't see the results right away, we can know that he is working things out for our good and His glory and we can trust him in that. I don't know who said it, but it definitely apply guys here. you can tell me in the comments if you know. but what you win them with is what you will win them to. if you win them with pragmatic arguments, you'll win them to more pragmatic arguments if you win them with God's word and his authority. that is what you'll win them too. hey guys, thanks so much for watching this video.

          "I find it insanely hypocritical that any Christian is against gay marriage. Especially when the Bible talks of Jacob, the man known as Israel, who had two wives that fought for his love, attention, and affection. They then bore him children even offering up their handmaids to bear their husband children. How is that keeping the sanctity of marriage? How is that one man and one woman. He is the father of the tribes of Israel. He had a personal relationship with God and was given the name Israel. Like what argument can you have for saying one man and one woman. It is false, and this story is the backbone in the lore of the Bible, the descendants of Jacob/Israel. The Bible promotes this altered family and people even ignore the ridiculousness of this relationship to focus on how Leah received good in the end in being buried near him. So to then turn around and say no to gay/lesbian relationships which are comprised of TWO CONSENTING ADULTS and not multiple people is wild to hear. It\u2019s not based around being given away like property to a man that doesn\u2019t want you, Leah, when he wanted the younger sister, Rachel. And again this relationship dynamic is odd given the close relation of all parties, Leah and Rachel are sisters and Jacob is their first cousin. So again very hypocritical. Also who is advocating for nonconsensual relationships or marriage? Jacob was tricked by his uncle after working for 7 years and given Leah to marry. He had no say even though they\u2019d made an agreement before hand that he\u2019d work for Rachel\u2019s hand. I think too many people are only regurgitating what someone has told them. Don\u2019t be followers of man- preachers, be informed. Question because to be against a consensual relationship is weird. Too many people skip around in the Bible and haven\u2019t read it from the beginning."

        "transcript": "we are directly talking about undermining God's plan as he has revealed it to us. we're replacing his authority with our own. if marriage is no longer between one man and one woman, are we open to the idea of polygamy? we disregard the heterosexual aspect, so why not the monogamous aspect too? if love is love, as we keep hearing, who is to say that three men loving each other is not more love? the two men loving each other? and I'm sure someone in this chamber has echoed the words Love Is Love Tonight. and this is not about love being loved. this is about marriage, the sacrament of holy matrimony. it is directly connected to love, but it's not the definition of love. too many people are to those words and confuse the meaning of Love. Agape, the Biblical context of Love, is a Divine love. it's a sacrificial love. it's not lustful. people often conflate sex with love. it's very disingenuous. we've heard quite a bit of that. but then, of course, atheists often part the words God is love, and we've heard that one tonight too, again without any understanding. yes, God is love, but he sets the terms, not us. another one we've heard plenty of is inclusivity. should the church be more inclusive? again, it's a play of works. it's it's virtue- signaling this- to appear good rather than to be good. the church should absolutely be inclusive. Christ spent time with tax collectors and prostitutes, but it is they who went away changed, not Christ. we are Fallen, therefore we are all sinners. the church is open to Sinners- of course it is. that's the purpose of the church, but it should not be to encourage people to continue to sin. our duty as clerics is to help lead people to Christ, to lead them away from sin, not to embrace it, not to affirm it. I know many LGBT people who live lives in Christ. they abstain from sexual gratification to be closer to God, and it's not easy. it really isn't. it's perhaps not fair, but it is right and it is good. and these people are being let down. I've had people crying saying I could have got married, but I did what the church taught me was right, and now the church is saying they were wrong. all along I've wasted my life as Christians. we're called to be in the world, but not of the world. in the secular world, we already have equality and law. people can enter civil Partnerships or even gay marriage outside of the church, and that's their prerogative. however, the faith is inherently discriminatory. God is discriminatory. he sets conditions on us entering his Heavenly Kingdom. it is not a free-for-all. we must turn away from sin, repent and follow Christ. and I want to specify: it is the sin that is the problem, not the sinner. every single person is loved by God and God forgives all of us of our depravity. but we have to turn away from our sins and turn toward him. and it seems the panel opposite me has forgotten to separate the sin from The Sinner. one can denounce sin while still welcoming The Sinner. so, as I wrap up, my message to the proposing side is: do not lead us astray. do not lead people astray. do not be the wolves in sheep's clothing. do not be the false teachers the Bible warns us about. remember your obligation to defend the faith. stop teaching about diversity, inclusion and equality and get back to teaching about Redemption and salvation. this is spiritual neglect. help people by telling them the truth. be kind to People by supporting them through those struggles and reminding them that Christ suffers with them, and be compassionate by Leading them to Christ when the world tries to lead them away from him. the church is imploding and the faithful masses have stopped turning up on Sundays and we are seeing the most rapid decline of Christianity in this country that we may have ever seen. do not accelerate it with heresy. you do not have the authority to bless sin. when I hear the bishop of London on record saying these new prayers will mean priests can bless same-sex relationships, some of which may be sexual in nature, I hear the devil at work. Bishops are promoting the idea of sacramental sodomy. let them be anathema, repent. and to the rest of you, I have no doubt that some of you will consider me a bigot or a transpho or a homophobe, but I am neither of those things, none of those things. I'm simply a follower of Christ, a Christian, and we are naturally counter-cultural. and if so-called liberals were truly diverse and tolerant, they would Embrace us just as they Embrace everyone else. and the point has been made. but the growing christopheric attitude around this public debate and the Ugly level of hypocrisy is that we really see people hold Muslims and people of other faiths to the same expectations that they hold Christians to. who is calling for the Quran to be updated to Modern societal Norms? the same patronizing attitude of people of other that treat other faiths, patronize other face while being intolerant towards Christians at the same time, it's a shame, but in the words of saint athanasius of Alexandria, if the world is against the truth, the name against the world.

        "transcript": "and, by the way you know, Paul tells us- I've said this before in the show, but Paul tells us What Love Is. uh, love is not affirming someone's sin, love, he says in First Corinthians 13. He says love is patient and kind. love does not in Envy or boast, it is not arrogant or rude, it does not insist on its own way, it is not irritable or resentful and- this is the key verse- it does not rejoice at wrongdoing but rejoices with the truth. so when you go to a wedding, a gay wedding, you're rejoicing at wrongdoing and it is, it's, it's I, and I talked about this before I, when I first got saved, my two agents at William Morris invited me, or one of them it was a, uh, was is a gay man and he was getting married to another man and he, they, he- invited me and I was put on the spot. we were at dinner. we were at dinner and one of the agents- she said, she turned to me and she said: you're going to- let's call him Joe, you're going to Joe's wedding, right, and I- and I thought at the time because I was a brand new Christian, I didn't know what to say and I was put on the spot. I was like, yes, of course I'm going, because I thought that was the loving thing to do. and, uh, it was. so I ended up going to the wedding. it was such a big mistake and I went because once I got there, it was all the way out somewhere far. it was like Malibu, but not Malibu or somewhere out there. and and I remember just walking in and seeing all the people coming and dressed up and everyone's so kind of happy and I was thinking, oh my gosh, wait, I'm here celebrating a wedding between a marriage between two men, and it really hit me hard and I I had a really difficult time that night. uh, and I and it taught me that was a very good lesson to me, because it I I learned that that loving people doesn't mean going to their gay wedding. in fact, in fact, as Christians, I believe that we should not go to gay like, if it's your son, your daughter, your niece who have, whomever, you should not attend the wedding, because it's first of all, my being at this wedding years ago was probably really confusing to some people there, because some of the people there knew I was a Christian and they probably thought, oh, like Beckett's here. so I guess this is all good, everything's okay, so it's it's a terrible witness to Christ. uh, so to go to it and it's also your celebrating sin is basically what you're doing. you're celebrating sin, you're in engaging in that celebration, and and so I? I, in my opinion, I think that Christians should not attend gay weddings. um, there may be some crazy circumstance where you can, but I and I, I would never, I would never go to a gay wedding again in my life. I will never go. um. and now you can. there's ways around that. you can tell the person who's having the wedding. if it's your niece who's having the wedding, I say, you can say: I love you, I, I absolutely love you, but I have these convictions about what marriage is and I, I cannot, I cannot go against my conscience. it is neither safe nor what. uh, what does Martin Luther say? it is neither safe nor uh- I can't remember the rest of the quote- when he's at the, the diet of vorms, um, but when he's asked to recant. but there's other ways to, to, to love your niece or whomever. you can go to dinner with your niece and your niece's friend, or whatever you can. you can invite them over to dinner. I mean, ask Rosario Butterfield, like that's how she ended up coming to faith in Christ. her past, the pastor and his wife kept inviting her over for dinner. her neighbor and kept inviting her over for dinner and and just basically loving on her for a long- I think it was over a year- and that's that's how we should do it and we can, you know, say, say to our loved one, or say to our family: remember, hey, like I love you so much, but I can't be a part of this, but I would love to have you guys over for dinner, I would love to take you guys out to dinner, I would love to. you know it's whatever, Etc. there are many other ways to to love your, your family members who are in the lgbtq community, um, and but going to the wedding, uh, for me, going to the wedding is a Red Line in the Sand because it's it's dishonoring to God, it's a confusing witness and it is. I think it's just bad for for you, as a Christian, to to engage and because you, it's like, it's like Romans 1, where Paul says: not only do they do such things, they give approval to those who do. so. you're, Your Presence at this wedding is almost kind of giving approval to what's happening, and so that's why I say it is uh, it's no bueno. so I hope that helped.

        "transcript": "[Applause] [Music]. [Applause] [Music]. [Applause] foreign. I was going to say thank you for the warm introduction, but I think instead I'll say thank you for the invitation. that's far more charitable. um, it's a genuine pleasure to speak here this evening. it really is. I'm happy to be back at the Oxford Union- it wasn't too long ago that I was based here myself- and I'm very happy to be part of an organization that is still standing up for free speech, still standing up for diversity of thought and opinion, going against the approved Narrative of Academia in the 21st century. so well done to you all for that. now, I genuinely struggled with this one. I've struggled sleeping this week. actually, I've. I don't get stage rights. I'd never get nervous when I go on television. I recently debated at the Cambridge Union and the Durham Union. no problem whatsoever. but this, there's something different about this one. it's been causing me anxiety. so someone kindly sent me Luke, chapter 12, verses 11 to 12, saying: and when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities, do not be anxious about how you should defend yourself and what you should say, for the holy spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say. I know there's something a bit ironic about me coming here with a speech after that, but why do I feel anxiety about this? well, we are up against the authorities, three bishops from the established church. that means either I am wrong and Christians have been teaching incorrectly for the last two thousand years, or and Jews and Christians for the last four to six thousand years, or we have church leaders attempting to drag the church into apostasy. neither way is good. the consequences are severe. this debate is not just happening in this chamber. this debate is happening in real time in the house of Bishops. as we speak, there's a growing number of vocal Bishops who want to change the term, the church's teaching on marriage, the results being the spiritual neglect of anglicans up and down this country. now I may have trained at the last remaining sound Anglican Seminary up the road, as in Steven's house, but I am a newbie deacon so perhaps I am on. I am wrong on this. let's consult people wiser than myself, starting with the church fathers. Saint Thomas Aquinas, in his summer theological, quite clearly identifies matrimony as being between one man and one woman, beneficial for begetting of children and for the good of Offspring, for both educational and developmental purposes, necessary for the Perfection of the community and for the worship of God. Saint Paul describes marriage as, therefore, a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife and they become one flesh, in which he is mirroring the language of Genesis, where God tells man and woman to be fruitful and multiply. both Aquinas and Paul refer to matrimony as a sacrament, a holy mystery in which one man and one woman are joined together in conjugal Union, with the potential to be blessed, by the grace of God, With Children to start a family for the worship of God. people will often argue in this debate: we know more about homosexuality now than we did then. maybe so, but are we really going to suggest that God knew less than than we know now? for either all of scripture is God breathed or it isn't. either we believe Christ or we don't. so let's refer to another source, the book of common prayer. one of the Anglican formula is an authority of liturgy and catechism in the Anglican Church. the prayer book lists three ordained reasons for matrimony. first, it was ordained for the procreation of children, to be brought up in the fear and nature of the Lord and to praise His holy name. second, it was ordained for a remedy against sin and to avoid fornication, that such persons, as had not the gift of constancy, might marry and keep themselves undefiled members of the church's body. and thirdly, it was ordained for the mutual Society help and comfort that one ought to have the other, both in prosperity and adversity. if we look wider abroad to the church Catholic, which defines in the catechism of the Catholic Church, matrimony: the matroneal confidence by which a man and a woman, established between themselves a partnership of the whole life, is by the nature ordered toward the good of the spouses and the procreation and education of Offspring. this Covenant between baptized persons has been raised by Christ, the Lord, to the Dignity of a sacrament. this is referred to as marriage in God's plan. so are we looking to alter the catechism of just Anglican church, or the Catholic Church too? should? should they all get with the times? two thousand years of Christian doctrine cannot be altered at the whim of a few liberal Bishops. what is God ordained cannot be adjusted to suit our new liberal, Progressive views. marriage is heterosexual and monogamous and should be open to the possibility of children. the Bible backs all of this up. it's very clear throughout on this matter, whether it's nine verses or 32 000 verses, marriages between one man and one woman for the purposes of procreation, sex outside of marriage, is a sin, and that is the same for heterosexuals as it is for homosexuals, although the Bible is quite clear that same-sex relations are abhorrent- and before some smart alec starts us asking me the question of whether I'm wearing mixed Fabrics, there is a difference between the moral laws and ceremonial laws, and Christ did come to fulfill the Old laws. both the issues of marriage and homosexuality, however, are still addressed in the New Testament, in Paul's Epistles, but also in the Gospels. Jesus does talk of marriage in Mark and Matthew, both in the context of heterosexual Union. so my question to the Bishops would be: do we not believe in the authority of scriptures anymore? can we pick and choose which parts of the Gospel we adhere to? the church, after all, is Christ's Sprite. as we heard earlier, Jesus is described as the bridegroom, so that we may know how he relates to us. two Grooms would be pointless. Christ is already in Union with the father and the Holy Spirit. it's us he's inviting in. two Brides is what we're looking at here. the church is attempting to marry itself and to leave Christ out of the picture. we are directly talking about undermining God's plan as he has revealed it to us. we're replacing his authority with our own. if marriage is no longer between one man and one woman, are we open to the idea of polygamy? we disregard the heterosexual aspect, so why not the monogamous aspect too? if love is love, as we keep hearing, who's to say that three men loving each other is not more love? the two men loving each other? [Music]. shame, and I'm sure someone in this chamber has echoed the words Love Is Love Tonight. and this is not about love being loved. this is about marriage, the sacrament of holy matrimony. it is directly connected to love, but it's not the definition of love. too many people are to those words and confuse the meaning of Love. Agape, the Biblical context of Love, is a Divine love. it's a sacrificial love. it's not lustful. people often conflate sex with love. it's very disingenuous. we heard quite a bit of that. but then, of course, atheists. often part of the words God is love, and we've heard that one tonight too, again without any understanding. yes, God is love, but he sets the terms, not us. another one we've heard plenty of is inclusivity. should the church be more inclusive? again, it's a play of works. it's, it's virtue signaling it's to appear good rather than to be good. the church should absolutely be inclusive. Christ spent time with tax collectors and prostitutes, but it is they who went away changed, not Christ. we are Fallen, therefore we are all sinners. the church is open to Sinners. of course it is. that's the purpose of the church, but it should not be to encourage people to continue to sin. our duty as clerics is to help lead people to Christ, to lead them away from sin, not to embrace it, not to affirm it. I know many LGB people. I know many LGBT people who live lives in Christ. they abstain from sexual gratification to be closer to God, and it's not easy. it really isn't. it's perhaps not fair, but it is right and it is good. and these people are being let down. I've had people crying saying I could have got married, but I did what the church taught me was right. and now the church is saying they were wrong. all along I've wasted my life as Christians. we're called to be in the world, but not of the world. the Trap that we're falling into in this debate is looking at the church Through The Eyes Of The World rather than through his kingdom. in the secular world, we already have equality and law. people can enter civil Partnerships or even gay marriage outside of the church, and that's their prerogative. however, the faith is inherently discriminatory. God is discriminatory. he sets conditions on us entering his Heavenly Kingdom. it is not a free-for-all. we must turn away from sin, repent and follow Christ. and I want to specify: it is the sin that is the problem, not the sinner. every single person is loved by God and God forgives all of us of our depravity, but we have to turn away from our sins and turn toward him. and it seems the panel opposite me has forgotten to separate the sin from The Sinner. one can denounce sin while still welcoming The Sinner. so, as I wrap up, my message to the proposing side is: do not lead us astray. do not lead people astray. do not be the wolves in sheep's clothing. do not be the false teachers that the Bible warns us about. remember your obligation to defend the faith. stop teaching about diversity, inclusion and equality and get back to teaching about Redemption and salvation. this is spiritual neglect. help people by telling them the truth. be kind to People by supporting them through those struggles and reminding them that Christ suffers with them, and be compassionate by Leading them to Christ when the world tries to lead them away from him. the church is imploding and the faithful masses have stopped turning up on Sundays and we are seeing the most rapid decline of Christianity in this country that we may have ever seen. do not accelerate it with heresy. you do not have the authority to bless sin. when I hear the bishop of London on record saying these new prayers will mean priests can bless same-sex relationships, some of which may be sexual in nature, I hear the devil at work.

        "transcript": "the literature of the ancient world, particularly starting in the Bronze Age, is full, if not rich, of all sorts of mentions of homerotic attraction in general. samex relationships, in other words, samesex attraction, is definitely not a modern invention. it's not a modern thing, and I want to go out on a limb and say it's probably as ancient as mankind itself. but what about homosexual marriage or, in general, same-sex marriage? is that a modern invention, or do we have evidence of homosexual marriages in the ancient period? as I have demonstrated over and over again on this channel, this is the one channel that does not have any agenda and does not try to push any ideology. namely, I tell it how it is. so what do the sources say? let's talk about it. hello Noble ones, welcome back to my channel. this is the Metatron speaking, and one of the earliest, most explicit examples and mentions of a homoerotic relationship is between the Mesopotamian hero gilgames and his lover en kidu. the theme and the idea of the hero and His companion at arms, connected by a brotherly love so deep as to enter the sphere of sexual attraction, is in fact a pretty common element in several Classics in ancient literature, sometimes explicit, other times less so. it of course goes without say that, even in the ancient period, brotherly love or friendship in arms doesn't always or necessarily mean that we are in the presence of homoerotic Attraction. however, different cultures understood this sort of love in very different ways throughout the centuries and since. today, our question is rather specific, since we actually want to know about marriage, so something that is institutionalized within a society by law. our investigation will not only be interdisciplinary, but we will be discussing several civilizations. in fact, these five: the ancient Romans, the ancient Greeks, Mesopotamia, the Hittites and ancient [Music] Egypt. when talking about same-sex relationships in the ancient world, one of the things we need to understand is that there are several aspects that need to be taken into consideration in order to make sure that we don't fall into the easy mistake of just expecting homosexual relationships to be understood, approached and lived in the same way. they would be, not only now specifically, but in general, for example, in the 20th century. to understand how same-sex love was perceived by the Ancients, we need to discuss this topic from an anthropological, cultural and ritualistic aspect. but with that out of the way, one thing we can absolutely state with confidence is that the Ancients were not ex strenuous to the concepts of same-sex love, but such relationships were not as free as one might expect, as they were in fact regulated by specific societal conventions, which would render them lawful in some situations and illicit in other situations, sometimes frowned upon by society and other times encouraged or used to boast. to be more specific, passive homosexuality tended to be stigmatized and only considered to be lawful, according to at least some people, either for the very young, like in the case of some Greeks, or the very old, as it would be the case for the Norse. this could be considered to be a generalization of the condition of same-sex relationships in the ancient world, drawn in Broad lines, and it acts as a basis for our next question, which is the title of this video. what about same seex marriage? within the Mesopotamian world? the question relating to homosexual marriage isn't the clearest one. in fact, the type of information we have in general en on this topic when it comes to the past is rather fragmentary, but we do have some magic formula, which we find present in the almanac of incantation from the second millennium BC, that can give us some very interesting information on this topic. it appears, in fact, that these forms of magical incantations favored love between a man and a woman, a woman to a man, but also of a man towards another man, and, regardless of how interesting of a piece of information this may be, it does not specifically talk about a legalized marriage in the sense of a contract. the first explicit reference to a homosexual marriage during the Bronze Age comes from the hittite world. the first tablet of the hittite laws, created between 1,650 BC to 1,500 BC, was specifically used for regulatory legislations when it comes to matrimony, and it talks specifically about the rules when it comes of the payment of the dowy, so an amount of money from the husband to the wife or the wife's family. special Arrangements present and discussed in tablet one conceded explicit legal Authority also to Slaves when it comes to pruiting a wife to themselves. we read: if a slave gives a DIY to a woman and takes her as a wife, no one must force him to give her back. this is from section 34. now check out section 36. if a slave gives the dowy to a young man and takes him to live with him in his own house as his spouse, no one must force him to give him back. so what this means is that, at least in the hittite world, if a male slave was going to give money to another man because he wanted to marry him, then this transaction would have been legal and protected by the law. now, unfortunately, the only piece of evidence we have is this one, specifically talking about slaves. but then again, if slaves are allowed to do something, logically speaking, in the majority of cases it can also be implied that a free man could have done the same within that Society. now, when we approach classical literature and specific political discussions on the ancient world, both in ancient Rome and in ancient Greece, the idea of homosexual love is mentioned, talked about all over the place, specifically in Plateau, but this does not mean that the ancient Greeks would have been favorable to the idea of homosexual marriage. in fact, it is in ancient Rome that we find the only actual examples of homosexual marriage between men, and they are both trying to portray the homosexual marriages of Emperor Nero and the homosexual marriages of Emperor elagabalus. now, when it comes to- I said it once in Latin, I'm just going to say it in English- elagabalus, when it comes to him, I have a dedicated video, so I'm not going to go into it again. you'll find a link in the description below, but since that video was dedicated to elagabalus. I did not mention Nero. Nero did marry a man. let's read it. this is reported by Casio Dio and it talks about how, after the death of his wife Sabina, whom he himself had killed out of anger since he was missing her- he decided to marry a woman, a young woman that looked like her. after which, however, he had a young libertus castrated. his name was sporo because he also looked like Sabina- and treated him in any way as a wife with time, even though he had already been married to a Liberto by the name of pagora. Nero formerly married sporo and gave him a dowy according to contract law law. so, if you notice, not only we have a mention of a marriage that is formally done through the law, but we have a mention of a marriage before with another libertus by the name of pagora. in that specific case, casuso is mentioning tagus. so, even though we do have evidence of homosexual marriage, these, as we read them through the literature and the perspective of the time, are always considered as a form of Extravaganza. these not only are not the norm, but we have no reason to believe the regular people. people had access to such exotic behaviors, and when I say exotic, I specifically talk about elagabalus, but also Nero. so what I'm trying to say is: these are Emperors, they're powerful men and they could do whatever they wanted, including defying a stablish law or established customs, and nobody could say anything, well until they kill the gabas, that is. and when it comes to the extravagant nature of such unions. still, we are told that during this first marriage between emperor Rano and the libertus Pitagora, they had a feast, and what we are told during The Chronicles of this event is that all sorts of very promiscuous activities occurred. we read: Naro, himself, contaminated by all sorts of natural and innatural desires, did not save any Abomination to complete his depraved existence, and after a few days he became officially, with all the rights and legitimacy of marriage, the wife of pagora. a covered, the Imperial head, Witnesses were invited to the place. the dowy, the marriage bed, the marriage torches were all there. everything in substance that a woman would want as she became a wife was given and openly showed. now, did this actually happen? I'm inclined to believe so, mostly because we have more than one mention, as we see. we have the indirect mention of casuso, we have the direct mention of takus, but on top of that, suetonius mentions this as well, even though he doesn't give the Liberto the name pagora, but calls him tororo. however, it's important to underline that, as we read these sources, they're clearly trying to paint the Emperors in the most negative light possible, but regardless of that, still there is precedent. this allegedly happened. so what about the regular people? could people who do not have the power of an emperor marry a person of the same sex if they so chose? legally speaking, Roman legislation does not seem to contemplate or include the possibility of homosexual marriage, and the situation with narrow does seem to be a form of extravagant Behavior. regardless of that, there is one passage that I think could be very interesting to mention, and that is from the theodosian code of 342 ad. this is once again a law that kind of depicts the situation of homosexual marriage in negative light. I mean this happens a lot. same seex attract, that people always had to struggle throughout the centuries. that is a fact, and trying to say otherwise does not do any favor to anyone. however, there are two possible interpretation of this law, so I want to give them both regardless. in the first interpretation or translation of this law, it would be a legislation or a maneuver that is trying to prohibit homosexual marriage. so if the government feels the need to prohibit something, it means that very thing was in fact done by the people, and at least to a certain numerical level, to have them involved. however, a secondary interpretation of this law gives us the idea that perhaps they weren't trying to ban homosexual marriage, but homosexual relationships instead. now, which one is the correct translation? very difficult to know, so I'll leave them both to you for your own personal research. now that we have discussed the ancient world, there is a thing or two that we have to say about the medieval period. now, clearly, in medieval Europe, with the rise of Christianity, homosexual relationships become something that needs to be done in secret. so samex Slavs have to hide it or be persecuted for it. with that being said, if you are familiar with not only legal codex but specifically ecclesiastic ones, you might have heard a word: adelo poesis. let's talk about it. within medieval archival history, it is possible to run into a certain type of document which specifically talks about a kind of legal Union between two men, ratified within the ecclesiastical World. these would include the creation of a very strong relationship, which also had economic implications, and the men that were joining in these kind of reports were promising to take care of each other, to share their income and work equally. and what's interesting about the adelo poesis is that it also worked as a will, in the sense that if one of the two men were to Die, the other one would inherit at least part of the other man's Heritage or patrimony. so, at least from a formal perspective, the practice of adelo poesis does remind us very much in its structure, that of marriage, and there is a specific historiographical modern school of thought that supports this idea, the main representative Being John Boswell, from the University of Yale. he is one of the first to propose the idea of identifying this specific kind of Union with an actual homosexual Union. it is, however, important to say that this specific position is not shared by the majority of historians. that is because they consider adelo poesis as an institutionalized form of political, commercial joint venture, military establishment or even brotherly love. and what's interesting is that the origins of such a union between men was not in fact to be found within the Christian Church of the medieval period, but instead in the Pagan pre-existing cultures, mostly in Eastern Europe, within the Orthodox church, but also within the Catholic church in the west, the atmology of the word also meaning to make a brother. and even though there are definitely connection to the central Slavic world, as I was mentioned, there is at least one occurrence that we know of within the ecclesiastical Catholic World, exemplified in a document found in the monastery of sanova in Spain, which today can be observed in the hisor National Archive of Madrid: a union between Pedro the and Muno van, stipulated on the 16th of April 1061. it is my opinion that, as a societal, specifically ecclesiastical practice, this was not intended to be sexual in nature, also because it is often underlined that such unions were to be similar to those of the Saints. with that being said, I would like to leave you with this thought for you to ponder: considering the fact that, as we said, homosexual couples and same-sex attraction and love absolutely existed in the medieval period in needed to be kept secret, is it really so impossible to believe that perhaps Sun men used this structure, pretending for it to be some sort of Brotherly Love, But in reality they were an actual couple. they just didn't tell the church. having a look in the world of ancient Egypt and trying to understand how the situ ation was, well, we don't have a lot of testimonies that really tell us about a specific legal ability to marry, for example, another man or for a woman to marry another woman. however, there is an indirect mentioning which we might want to look at. a certain level of connection and interaction between the ancient Israelites in biblical literature and ancient Egypts is well known and specifically in The Book of Leviticus, we have some mentions of homosexuality within the biblical text, which we are now discussing from a secular perspective only now, rather than reading The Book of Leviticus itself, which is something I usually do on this channel, jumping directly into Interlinear. so we normally examine word by word the Hebrew text, but that's for a separate series. by the way, Link in the description to the episodes, if you're interested. the connection I have to today's topic has to do with Rabin literature. instead, in the book of cifra, as a comment com AR, we could say to the information and Commandments given in The Book of Leviticus, we read: you will not copy the practices of the land of Egypt and of the land of Canaan and you will not follow their laws. so what are these laws? well, let's read: a man would marry a man and a woman would marry a woman and a man would marry a woman and her daughter or a woman being married by two men. so if we were to believe that this interpretation and examination of The Book of Leviticus, which we find in the cifra, it would point us to the idea that both Egyptians and canans by law allowed these kind of marriages to happen. it is, however, important to underline the fact that, since this is a book that was created externally to the cultures that we are discussing, we don't know if this was some sort of slander or an attempt at discussing Customs that the author was trying to push as inappropriate specifically because foreign. so it's a pretty weak point of reference, but I thought it was interesting to mention. well, as always, let me know what you think about this very question and, in general, this topic in the comments below, as always. thank you so much for watching. not a member of this community become a no one. subscribe to my channel for more content from the Metatron and remember the Metatron has spread his wings. goodbye.",

        "transcript": "why does the catholic church hate gay people? does she? let's take a look, hey, if you're new to this channel. we're all about exploring how our earthly bodies reveal heavenly and divine mysteries. if you want to dive deeply into questions about what it means to be male and female in the image of god and how this reveals the meaning of the universe, you're going to want to subscribe to this channel. we're continuing our series from my book good news about sex and marriage. we're in a new chapter, chapter 8, on questions of same-sex attraction and homosexuality, and we're looking at this question if you're following along, or on page 141. if you want to follow along and you don't have a copy of the book, check out the link below. here's the question: why does the catholic church hate gay people? i was born this way. that means god made me gay and god doesn't make mistakes. all right, let's press in here. first of all, the church does not hate anyone. infidelity to christ. she loves everyone without exception. also, in fidelity to christ, the church knows that to love is to desire the person's true good, and that means inviting everyone to embrace the full truth of his or her humanity as a man or woman made in the image and likeness of god. to love someone cannot possibly mean approving of anything and everything that person might do. love has a definition, and when we step out of the definition of love, we are definitely not loving. so, really, what we're getting at here is what is the truth of the human person and what is the truth of love? let's keep pressing in here. of course, this is an invitation that can stir resentment. what invitation? to live the full truth of our humanity, because it challenges us to our core and we tend not to like being challenged. my challenge to you and my challenge to myself is to let the truth of love and to let the truth of our humanity challenge us right. ask any question you have. throw every question up against the truth. the truth is not afraid of our questions. the question is: are we afraid of the truth? we shouldn't be. the truth sets us free, right in that resentment, when we're challenged to embrace the truth. it's easier to level accusations against the church than it is to look honestly at the church's proposal, and that's what we're trying to do here. i'm not here to impose anything on anybody. i just want to propose to you what the church proposes so that we can give it a fair hearing. we've been unfolding this proposal in lots and lots of videos and here's the basic proposal: when it comes to human sexuality, there was an original, beautiful plan that god had for making us male and female, to put it in the biblical expression. there was an original plan and we have fallen from it. this original plan was that the holy communion of man and woman, the two in one flesh, was a sign in this world of god's eternal giving love. god himself is an eternal exchange of life-giving love. the father from all eternity is generating the son in the power of the holy spirit, and it's as if the trinity had a conversation amongst themselves and they said: let's make a creature in our image, male and female. he created them and he blessed them with the power to generate new life generation. that's why god gave us genitals. god's love is generous, it generates. that's why god gave us genitals and that's the origin of the meaning of the word gender. that greek root gen means to produce, to give birth to. gender, in the original meaning of the word, means the manner in which you generate new life, and that's determined by the genital difference, male and female. he created them and he blessed them and he said: be fertile. in other words, our creation is male and female. the whole mystery of human sexuality and the call of the two to become one flesh is to be a sign in this world of the eternal generating power of the trinity. this is who we are. this is who god made us to be in the beginning. and there's an enemy who doesn't want us to know this about ourselves. there's an enemy who has blinded us to the true plan of god for our sexuality, because if we live it, it's going to launch us like a rocket into the mystery of the trinity, into heaven. and there's an enemy who doesn't want us to reach heaven right. this enemy wants to keep us from this heavenly joy and he's gotten in the mix here and he's convinced us that god's design for our lives was not to be trusted. so each of us has gone his or her own way. that's the proposal of the catholic church: that the way the world is today, the way we experience sexuality today, is not the way god made it to be. now, this person who submitted this question to me, saying: god made me gay and god doesn't make mistakes- the second part is absolutely true. god does not make mistakes, but we do, and that's the point. the biggest mistake we have ever made was the mistake of failing to trust god's plan for our lives. as a result, we now live in a fallen world and if we're honest here, we have to recognize that when we say we live in a fallen world, it doesn't just mean that that fallen world is out there somewhere, it doesn't just mean something's wrong out there. if we're honest, we gotta look deep inside and recognize that something is wrong in here. something has gone off in here. it's not just those people, something is off in each and every one of us and that brokenness, that thing that is off, it's manifested in a very particular way in our sexuality. the enemy is after the most valuable things, right. if you want to know what is most sacred in this world, if you want to know what is most sacred in our humanity, you only have to look at that which the enemy most violently attacks and which he most violently profanes. that's where we're going to find what's most valuable. and the church is proposing to us- and it's it's a serious proposal that we should take seriously- that there's an enemy who's screwing with us here. there's an enemy who doesn't want us to know who we really are as men and women made in the image and likeness of god? if that's true, we should want to know about it, and we should also want to know the good news that christ came into the world to restore creation to the purity of its origins. the beginning before sin is the norm for a proper understanding of how god made us. hence christ's proclamation. remember the pharisees. come to him. they ask him about divorce. is it okay for man to divorce his wife? and jesus says: in the beginning it was not so right. and what jesus is saying here is not just true. for divorce, right. what jesus is saying here can be applied to anything that concerns manifestations of our broken, fallen humanity. if there's anything we can say about erotic attraction to one's own sex, we can say this: with christ in the beginning it was not so. something has gone wrong here. something has disoriented in each and every one of us, not only in those who experience same-sex attraction, but in each and every one of us. something has disoriented our sexual desires. god's plan in the beginning for sexual desire was to love in the divine image, freely, totally, faithfully and life-givingly. right, free, total, faithful, fruitful love, as we've been saying for so long in the videos on this channel. this is god's plan for sexual desire and this is what marriage is. it's god's plan for living out a free, total, faithful, fruitful, life-giving, generative love. this is god's plan in the beginning for our sexuality. that's how we experienced it in the beginning. that's why man and woman were both naked and felt no shame. but again, this is the proposal: take it or leave it. something has gone wrong in the way each and every one of us experience sexual desire. we are all in one way or another. all of us are sexually disoriented, and it's okay that we're broken here because there's a solution. but it is not okay to call our brokenness health. it's okay that each and every one of us, in one way or another, we are disoriented here. it's okay because there is a solution. christ came into the world to restore creation to the purity of its origins, but it is not okay to point to our sexual brokenness and say: this is the way god made me. the inclination towards erotic relationships with one's own sex is just one thing in a very long list of inclinations that, as saint john tells us in his first letter, come not from the father, but from the fallen world in which we live. remember saint john. this is 1 john 2, 15-17. he's talking about the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes and the pride of life. he says these come not from the father, they come from the fallen world in which we live. so it's not correct to say god made me this way. if we want to understand how god made us, we have to go back to the beginning. we're all in the same boat here. we are all fallen. fallenness manifests itself differently in different people, but there is no human being who is not in need of the redemption. christ came into the world to win for all of us. again, here's the good news. i quote the catechism here: jesus came to restore creation to the purity of its origins. right. so long as we justify our broken humanity, so long as we say things like this is the way god made me, we close ourselves off to the beautiful plan that god has to re-make us in jesus christ. as saint john paul the second observes- and i quote him here- if we are to live as the men and women god made us to be, we must rediscover the lost fullness of our humanity and want to regain it. my brothers and sisters, i know that this teaching of the church in particular is difficult and we're touching on some really sensitive stuff. whether you personally experience same-sex attraction or not, there's hardly anyone in the modern world who's not touched by this because of someone near and dear to them. i promise you this as we continue this conversation: we're going to enter in with delicacy, with compassion, with sensitivity, but we're going to proclaim the truth in love. when love is disconnected from truth, it's not loving, and when truth is disconnected from love, it's not the truth. we have to hold the two together. i have so much more to share with you. i look forward to future videos. in the meantime, if you're interested in ongoing formation and what the theology of the body institute offers, check the links below. until next time, may our eyes continue to be opened to the hope that christ holds out to us of living the full truth of who we really are as men and women made in the image and likeness of god.",

          "The Roman Catholic Church is the most cruel and inhumane institution there is, because it means to condemn homosexuals to a life of solitude, aloneness, misery, anguish, sadness, without any crime having been committed against anyone. This is absolutely cruel and inhumane. There is nothing worse than being told that you must grow old and end your days in solitary desolation. And the answer Catholics give to that is that you must &#39;endure your cross.&#39; But some go as far as suggesting suicide and even pushing legally for life imprisonment and the death penalty to be carried out by the state in the form of a totalitarian theocracy with a theocratic and totalitarian legal system that criminalizes and punishes with life imprisonment and death homosexuals. All this is anathema to basic human dignity and ethics, basic respect for human life. This is taking the position of total and complete dehumanisation of homosexuals and wishing gratuitous death from pure hatred of your fellow neighbours. This cruelty of the Roman Catholic Church is beyond depraved and obscene. It is revolting and that is the true nature of the abominable Roman Catholic Church.<br><br><b>FULL BREAKDOWN (ChatGPT):</b><br><br>In a libertarian ethical framework, the fundamental principle is the respect for individual liberty and autonomy. Let&#39;s break down the statement from that perspective:<br><br>1. <b>Respect for Individual Liberty:</b> The Catholic Church&#39;s stance on homosexuality, particularly condemning it as a sin, conflicts with libertarian principles of individual liberty. In a libertarian society, individuals have the right to live their lives as they see fit, as long as they do not harm others or infringe upon their rights.<br><br>2. <b>Non-Aggression Principle:</b> Libertarianism upholds the non-aggression principle, which means that initiating force or coercion against others is morally wrong. The statement suggests that advocating for legal penalties such as life imprisonment or the death penalty for homosexuals constitutes aggression against them, which goes against libertarian principles.<br><br>3. <b>Freedom of Association:</b> Libertarians typically support freedom of association, meaning individuals have the right to form relationships and associations as they choose. The Catholic Church&#39;s teachings on homosexuality, which can lead to ostracization and condemnation, may be seen as infringing upon individuals&#39; freedom to associate with whomever they wish.<br><br>4. <b>Role of the State:</b> In a libertarian ethical framework, the role of the state is limited to protecting individual rights and maintaining a system of justice. The statement criticizes the idea of a state enforcing theocratic laws that criminalize homosexuality, which conflicts with the libertarian view of limited government intervention in personal matters.<br><br>Overall, from a libertarian perspective, the statement highlights how the Catholic Church&#39;s stance on homosexuality and its potential influence on legal systems can be seen as violating individual liberty, the non-aggression principle, freedom of association, and the proper role of the state.",

The main accuser against sexologist Alfred Kinsey was Dr. Judith Reisman. Reisman advanced the thesis that homosexuals and pedophiles played an important role in the formation of the Nazi or National Socialist party. Kinsey worked with a former member of this German party, himself a bisexual and pedophile. The entire description of research at the institute is very brutal and comparable to the pseudo-medical research of Dr. Mengele. The topic of bisexual pedophilia among Nazi women was carefully addressed in the book and film ,,Lektor&quot;.",

This is already in Poland and nothing happened to these children, they didn't die or have any disease because of it. It's society that offends everyone through their ignorance, if you did proper programs etc. Then more people would be tolerant, then more people would want to live in Poland, for example from another country where there is homophobia. And children who would be adopted would have more opportunities and could help society more, only that the president has his own views and his decisions are influenced by religion, which of course he listens to only when it is convenient for him. In the Bible it was that you can't have tattoos, sex before marriage, you have to love, help others. Jesus himself walked in dresses and met with 12 men and god is a non-binary person because he has no gender and is an entity. He is called lord god because men once ruled.

          "The Gay Index cited can also be interpreted in another way. In metropolitan societies - more progressive, more tourist-attracting societies that tend to be academic centers - there is greater social acceptance of homosexuality than in smaller, provincial communities. By force, more people identify themselves (to themselves and to society) as homosexuals in centers that simultaneously have higher levels of education and tax revenue. So the cause-and-effect relationship here may be less clear. <br>One progressive politician (at the first Campus) explicitly said that first civil unions, then same-sex marriages, and then the right to adopt children by such couples, which was quite frankly received by opponents of the last two of these legal changes. <br>Outside of that, every time the topic gets high-profile, there is either a background discussion of tax increases or tighter climate policies that could hit a larger group of voters financially. The issue of civil unions seems to have been cynically used in recent years as a &quot;smokescreen&quot; or substitute topic by politicians of both dominant political options.",

          "Adoption by homosexual couples is rather a no-no, for the reason that the child, however, models the norms of family life 95% at home. And in the case where there is no mom or no dad in the family, there is no such example showing in practice how problems are solved in a heterosexual relationship, what customs are, how to understand and deal with a man and a woman, in ordinary mundane everyday life, in changing light bulbs, fixing a faucet. The absence of a mother or father, however, usually leaves a certain emptiness in children. It's hard for me to imagine that an extra mother would make up for my lack of a father, or one extra father for my lack of a mother. But I grew up in a heteronormative family, so that's probably where I get my perspective from - in any case, a very Heavy topic.<br><br>I would like to remind you that a large part of the lgbt community is not even about just independence and freedom with respect for each other's boundaries. Many of them want everyone to be lgbt, and same-sex marriage is a foot-in-the-door technique for them. <br><br>The more privileges they are given, the more they will want, until eventually there is discrimination in the other direction. In the states there are such voices that not wanting to date someone Trans is already transphobia and a potential reason to stigmatize someone. The suffix &quot;-phobia&quot; is really much abused. Phobia suggests irrational fear, and fear of being ostracized and deprived of civil liberties and human rights is not irrational fear, history shows that such things happened not so rarely.<br><br>Changes in inheritance taxes could be quite ok. Although they also raise questions about extortionate inheritance cases and such, so the family should have the right to challenge the inheritance.<br><br>People who disagree with these precautions about &quot;inheritance hunters&quot; cite as an argument that there are also &quot;inheritance hunters&quot; in heterosexual relationships. This is not a lie, but the union between a man and a woman has an even more important goal than hedonism: Procreation. Someone may call me primitive or conservative, but nevertheless, procreation is one of the cornerstones of the survival of the species, because if their parents didn't procreate, they wouldn't even be in the world to be able to practice hedonism<br><br>Procreation, however, makes people have more responsibility for themselves and for the other person. <br><br>Hedonism, however, is more often associated with taking advantage of people for one's amusement than with any higher purpose.",

          "Since marriage is always (that's what this video would imply) the responsibility of raising offspring, why not ban marriages of elderly people who can no longer have children. We don't do this because these people would no longer have children anyway, they are a fairly small part of society and such marriages make life easier for these people. It is exactly the same with same-sex marriages. Legally, there is currently nothing to prevent the recognition of same-sex marriages while at the same time not giving them the ability to adopt children (Article 18 provides protection for heterosexual marriages, it does not do the same for hypothetical marriages or same-sex unions, so by all means they would not have to be &quot;the same entity&quot;).<br><br>Parenthood of homosexuals is a completely separate topic, but it has also been raised here, and in a way that is totally disconnected from reality. One tries to create the impression as if the claim that the children of same-sex couples develop as well as the children of heterosexual couples should be based on some Newsweek calculation cd. of salary levels. Well, no. The topic has been addressed by scientists for a long time, there are a ton of studies on the subject. A child draws patterns from a variety of sources, the most important thing for proper development is, above all, a sense of security, stability and care from parents. It's hard to provide this to a child, even if only in a children's home, and it's also not facilitated by parents remaining in an informal relationship.",

One point of view I can see as rational is that if they're going to be called the Church of Norway, and take up all the space they do, they should represent Norwegian values.<br>One way of rephrasing the question you're asking is \"I don't understand why people should stand up for their rights in this country\". It doesn't matter to someone who would like to get married in the Norwegian Church (someone who is Christian and gay, for example), what kind of smart thoughts you have about what belongs in the Church.<br>Then you don't want to fight for that cause.

          "\"I don't understand why homosexuals want to get married in church\" is, of course, a completely uncontroversial opinion to form.

          "The expression \"telling it like it is\" is also a contradiction in terms if you consider that there are different perspectives on the issues you present, e.g. political correctness vs. \"straightforwardness\" (is this the right word?). The reason why people react when you say that \"I don't understand why homosexuals want to get married in church\" is because it's about values. Everyone knows that the church and religion in general have been oppressive, especially towards minorities, because they have long functioned as a power structure and worldview. For a large part of modern man \"God is dead\", which has made us reflect on whether all the frameworks belonging to religion are legitimate (changing or having different theological views within a religion is also normal, and unfortunately there is no \"truth\" in theology at least from an outside perspective e.g. Sunni vs. Shia). There are several elements of the Bible that need to be changed in order to fit into life today, which is obvious as it is over a thousand years since it was written. Opening up or expressing openness to allowing homosexuals to marry in church is seen as something to do because it can help remove the oppression that has been going on for many years and made many people unhappy. I understand that theoretically or hypothetically it may seem interesting to, for example, create a separate church for homosexuals where heterosexuals are oppressed, but this is basically just a way of proposing a solution where the heteronormative is released from its responsibility to be inclusive. Perhaps this can help to understand why people get upset about a debate in which someone expresses \"telling it like it is\" when they are arguing from a theoretical standpoint while those on the other side are arguing from values and attitudes. I'll end with an over-quoted quote:  &quot;you must not tolerate so fervently the injustice that does not affect yourself&quot;.",
